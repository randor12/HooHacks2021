Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock is up 4.2% in 11:20 a.m. EDT trading Friday on a pair of positive news reports. In one, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is quoted as playing down the challenge of Apple\\'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) new App Tracking Transparency tool that prompts users to decline giving Facebook (and other apps) \"permission to track you across apps and websites.\" \\xa0 In a second item, Facebook is said to be expanding its potential audience of Instagram users by working up a version of the site suitable for use by children under age 13. \\xa0 Image source: Getty Images. Regarding the Apple kerfuffle, Zuckerberg told listeners on voice-chatting app Clubhouse that Facebook will be \"able to manage\" the disruption from Apple\\'s move and remains \"in a good position\" despite it. Clarifying his reasoning on CNBC, he explained that if Apple makes it harder to track consumers\\' behavior online, it will make this harder to track for everyone, including businesses other than Facebook that want insight into consumers\\' behavior. \"By making it harder for [these other businesses] to use their data in order to find the customers that would want to use their products outside of our platforms,\" explains Zuckerberg, Apple may actually encourage these businesses to pay Facebook more for its assistance gathering such data. And regarding the Instagram change, Facebook has apparently made expanding Instagram to the tween and pre-tween set a \"priority\" for the company. Instagram Product VP Vishal Shah confirmed to BuzzFeed News yesterday that Instagram will be \"accelerating our integrity and privacy work to ensure the safest possible experience for teens and ... building a version of Instagram that allows people under the age of 13 to safely use Instagram for the first time.\" (By the way, Facebook owns Instagram.) Of the two stories, I actually suspect that the Apple news -- this duel between tech titans -- is the more important. Kids aren\\'t dumb, after all. They certainly realize that they can overcome the \"age verification challenge\" on Instagram by simply entering a birth date that would make them seem old enough to use the app -- if they really want to. Expanding Instagram eligibility really just makes that official, and perhaps gives parents a bit more peace of mind. On the effects of Apple\\'s iOS14 change, however, and its campaign for greater privacy for its users, it remains to be seen whether Zuckerberg is right or wrong about this being a net positive for Facebook. For the time being, investors appear to be giving him the benefit of the doubt -- and taking heart from the fact that the CEO is at least working the problem, and working on a solution.

       "  'The latest 13F reporting period has come and gone, and Insider Monkey is again at the forefront when it comes to making use of this gold mine of data. We at Insider Monkey have plowed through 887 13F filings that hedge funds and well-known value investors are required to file by the SEC. The 13F filings show the funds\\' and investors\\' portfolio positions as of December 31st. In this article we look at what those investors think of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). Is Facebook (FB) stock a buy or sell? FB investors should pay attention to an increase in activity from the world\\'s largest hedge funds lately. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) was in 242 hedge funds\\' portfolios at the end of December. The all time high for this statistic was previously 213. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that FB ranks 3rd among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings). Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that a select group of hedge fund holdings outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 124 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that\\'ll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 17th. That\\'s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

With hedgies\\' sentiment swirling, there exists a select group of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were adding to their stakes meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions).

Gobi Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 21.76 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to FB.

That figure was $38234 million in FB\\'s case. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the least popular one with only 68 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for FB is 99. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 26 percentage points. These stocks gained 7% in 2021 through March 12th and still beat the market by 1.6 percentage points. Unfortunately FB wasn\\'t nearly as successful as these 30 stocks and hedge funds that were betting on FB were disappointed as the stock returned -1.7% since the end of the fourth quarter (through 3/12) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the more diversified list of the top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.

The bankâs Financial Policy Committee found that vulnerabilities in the market remain almost a year after they first emerged during a rout at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent appearances, Bailey has said that while officials are watching a surge in bond yields carefully, so far they viewed it as consistent with an improvement in economic outlook. The summary of the FPCâs March 18 meeting agreed with that assessment, but also highlighted risks to liquidity that were exposed by the sell off in debt markets in March 2020.âIn February, the fragile nature of liquidity in some government bond markets had been evident during a period where advanced economy government bond yields had risen markedly,â the BOE report said. âThe FPC judged that recent experience showed the fundamental vulnerabilities in market functioning that had been exposed during the âdash for cashâ remained and could amplify any further repricing.âThe central bank noted recent weak demand from non-dealers at U.S. Treasury auctions after a disastrous sale last month that helped push yields to a higher plane. Bonds have sold off around the globe in recent weeks, pushing U.K. yields to the highest levels since before the pandemic.The European Central Bank confronted the shift with a vow to speed up its own asset purchase program. BOE officials gave tacit approval to the increase in yields, declining to intervene in the market in their last decision on monetary policy on March 18.BOE policy makers also discussed:How online shopping and working from home will change the structure of the economy.The panel saw risks from weaker earnings prospects and insolvencies that are likely to rise from their current very low levelsThe FPC released details of previous discussions about the implications of a disorderly Brexit for open-ended commercial real estate funds.

The S&P 500 and Dow rose in a broad-based rally on Friday with technology, healthcare and financial stocks providing the biggest lift as investors bet on a recovery that is expected to deliver the fastest economic growth since 1984.  The S&P 500 and the Dow ended a seesaw week higher as investors rebalancing their portfolios at the quarter\\'s end continued to buy stocks that stand to benefit from a growing economy while they added some beaten-down technology shares.

(Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation is set to be contained just above the Federal Reserveâs 2% target, and rising market interest rates are a sign of optimism about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.âOur forecast is for inflation to creep up to 2%, and our goal is to have it hit above 2% this year. Our forecast is around 2.1%, but we donât see it running out of control,â Harker said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee.Since January, longer-term interest rates have risen as investors have incorporated positive news on vaccine developments and the prospect for massive fiscal aid, factors which should speed the economic recovery. Thatâs translated into higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, but Harker brushed aside concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on growth.âGood SignââThis is a good sign, in some ways, that rates -- say, the 10-year -- is going up,â Harker said, referring to the 10-year Treasury yield. âPeople are more optimistic about the economy. Weâve been hovering at zero or negative neutral real rates for a while, so the fact that thatâs rising is a good sign because it shows optimism.âThe U.S. central bankâs Federal Open Market Committee, on which Harker sits but does not have a vote on policy decisions this year, published updated quarterly economic projections following its meeting last week. The projections were the first since December -- before the Democratic partyâs victory in January Senate races paved the way for more fiscal relief -- and they showed that Fed officials generally see inflation hovering just above the Fedâs 2% target over the next few years.Thatâs in line with the central bankâs new strategy unveiled last August, in which Fed officials will seek above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation, so that it averages 2% over time.âI am of the camp where we stick with our framework and we let inflation run above 2% for a while -- not out of control past 2%,â Harker said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Asda bosses have lost an equal pay fight with tens of thousands of store workers in a Supreme Court ruling in a \"watershed moment\" for the industry. More than 44,000 current and former workers, about two-thirds of whom are women, brought equal pay claims saying staff working in distribution depots, most of whom are men, are paid more. The Supreme Court backed an earlier Court of Appeal judgment that ruled store workers are entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff for equal pay purposes. The decision, a landmark precedent for the private sector, will send shockwaves through the industry, paving the way for compensation claims against other supermarkets totalling as much as Â£8bn. Equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue, but the ruling demonstrates that private sector firms are not immune and could open the floodgates to more claims. \"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those that have similar staffing models and pay structures,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood.

Earlier this week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced that customers could now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Ark Invest\\'s Cathie Wood isnât so sure investors should use it as a means of payment. What Happened: In a webcast hosted by CBOE, Wood said that those that made profits from Bitcoinâs rally may be the subject of scrutiny by the IRS. The ARK Invest founder explained, \"The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don\\'t think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front.â Why It Matters: From a tax point of view, the IRS currently treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as âproperty,â as they do stocks and bonds. As a result, when investors sell their Bitcoin for fiat currency or use it as a means to purchase another good, they could be subject to massive capital gains taxes. Capital gains on taxes on assets that have been held for less than a year are taxed the same as a personâs âother income,â while assets that are held for longer than this period would be subject to long-term capital gains taxes ranging from 15-20%. While this would make any Tesla purchases with Bitcoin somewhat unfavorable for those that bought the cryptocurrency last year, more recent investors may actually benefit from the current rules. For instance, if an investor purchased the leading cryptocurrency at a higher price than its current value, he or she could actually report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the value of the asset. Price Action: After a volatile week, Bitcoin price recovered from yesterday\\'s low of $50,856 to $53,900 today. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $53,223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Stories Should you Buy a Tesla with BTC?

Several of the large US investment banks are bullish on gold. As a reminder, last year Bank of America made their forecast for gold to hit US$3000/oz Nowhere is this clearer than in Nigeria, where the central bank is so worried about Nigerians choosing cryptocurrencies over the naira for overseas remittance payments that it is now paying them to use official channels for those transfers instead.  The central bank announced the scheme after international remittances inflows plummeted last year, as more Nigerians abandoned official banking channels by turning to cheaper cryptocurrency exchanges.  The move came on the heels of a nationwide crackdown on banks dealing in cryptocurrencies, which the government enacted in an attempt to counteract the nairaâs declining value. For more than a year now, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has been ripping higher off of its pandemic lows. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday the stock market rally has been supported by four major pillars over the past year. Unfortunately, two of those pillars may now be cracking, putting the market at risk in the near-term. Essaye listed the following four bullish catalysts as pillars of the stock market rally over the past year. 1. Government stimulus. The U.S. government has already spent about $6 trillion in stimulus to prop up the economy throughout the pandemic downturn. The recent $1.9-trillion stimulus package will likely be the last one, and Essaye said this stock market pillar is now cracked. âBottom line, the outlook for government spending is turning much more mixed, because while there may be more spending (which is good for growth), itâs going to come with tax increases (which is bad for growth), and that mixed outlook is a departure from the past year (where it was all spending and no tax increases),â Essaye said. Related Link: Could Long-Term Capital Gains Selling Be Weighing On The Market? 2. Federal Reserve Accommodation. The Fed dropped its target fed funds interest rate range to between 0% and 0.25% and has been purchasing $120 billion in assets per month to help maintain a healthy credit market. Essaye said this pillar is now also cracked given a growing number of Fed officials said they see a rate hike coming in 2022 as of the Fedâs most recent dot plot projections. 3. Vaccine Optimism. Essaye said vaccine optimism has been a bullish catalyst throughout the rally, from positive critical trial data to FDA approvals to a U.S. vaccine rollout that\\'s now ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Essaye said financial markets have already priced in an end to the pandemic within the next few months, so it\\'s unclear how much stock market upside the vaccine rollout can provide moving forward. 4. No Double-Dip Recession. It seems like a lifetime ago that investors were concerned about a potential double-dip recession in 2020 or 2021. However, employment and earnings have been steadily trending in the right direction, and the chances of a double-dip recession appear extremely low at this point. Benzingaâs Take: The economy is well-positioned to bounce back aggressively in 2021. It remains to be seen if there is more upside to stock prices once support from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve are scaled back.

(NASDAQ: FB). What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is âoff limits right nowâ as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors. Thill said that compared to other companies in the tech sector, Facebook is a âcheap name.â â$15 of earnings power and a mid 20 [P/E] multiple on it, and you are at $350 to $375 on the stock. So you got a lot of upside still on Facebook. We like that,â the analyst added.

Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) is down over 30% since it reached an all-time-high of $159.70 on Feb. 16, but options traders may be seeing more downside for Cathie Woodâs fund, which holds shares of companies that Wood feels are disruptive innovators. The ARKK Trades: At 2:09 p.m. Thursday a trader executed a put sweep of 7,238 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring April 16. The trade represented a $38,000 bearish bet for which the trader paid $5.25 per option contract. At 1:04 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 400 ARKK options with a $110 strike price expiring on Jan. 20, 2023. The trade represented a $1.4-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $26 per option contract. At 11:16 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,500 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring May 21. The trade represented a $2.49-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.60 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 819 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.35-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,028 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.7-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,087 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May 21. The trade represented a $1.78-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.40 per option contract. Together, traders are betting almost $8.76 million that the share price of ARKK is going lower. Why Itâs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating a large move in stock price will occur imminently. A sweeper pays market price for the call options, instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates âsmart moneyâ has entered into a position. About ARKK: Cathie Woodâs Ark ETFs have been wildly popular this year, and retail investors watch the fundâs activity daily to see which companies are being bought and sold. ARKK holds numerous stocks in this fund popular with retail traders such as Telsa Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Although ARKK holds some pharmaceuticals and biosciences companies, most of its holdings are in the tech sector, which is in a rout.

Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201.\\t\\t After such a bumpy week, Friday gave us a quiet and sleepy session in the stock market. That said, letâs look at a few top stock trades for Monday.\\xa0 Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) continues to trade well, as bulls bid it off the session low. Coming into Friday, Bitcoin prices are up in six out of the past sessions. Itâs now sitting back up at the highs. Notice on the dip, Bitcoin bottomed just above the top of the prior range. The low came in at $43,171 while the high from the prior range is at $41,969. I know the extensions sound kind of confusing, but this name is a great technical trade, so they are worth knowing. The 261.8% extension from the prior range (drawn in blue) sits up near $63,000. The 161.8% extension of the current range is all the way up near $67,700 (drawn in black). If Bitcoin can clear $58,500 and make a push over $60,000, these are the levels that my attention would shift to. On the downside, however, watch the 10-day moving average. Below could put $50,000 back in play. Below that puts the 50-day moving average on the table. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) continues to swoon as the headlines remain unfavorable. The Chinese government is cracking down, and thatâs not doing any favors for Alibaba. The chart shows just as much. Perhaps investors will want to pass on Alibaba for stocks that are more in favor. However, Alibaba is likely getting attractive for value buyers, down almost 30% from the highs. Shares are bouncing off the $230 area after filling the recent gap. Incidentally, this area is also the 2020 pre-coronavirus high. If shares can take out this weekâs high near $242, then a push up toward the 50-day moving average and $250 is in the cards. If we break this weekâs low, Alibaba may need to retest the 100-week moving average. Below that, and the December low is in play.  JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) reported pretty good earnings earlier this week, but quickly faded from those gains and is falling lower on Friday. The stock is now stumbling into the weekend at its weekly low, after breaking $85.22. From here, bulls would love a flush down toward $80. That would likely be (but not guarantee) a great dip-buying opportunity. Not only is there support between $78 to $80, but the 200-day moving average is also in play there. On the upside, though, we need to see JD stock fill Fridayâs gap and reclaim the 10-day and 100-day moving averages. If these measures are resistance, shares could retest whatever low ends up being put in on the current decline. FAANG has been sleeping for months, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is no exception. The stock has been consolidating for months now, as it continues to put in a series of lower highs. It looked like it was trying to clear downtrend resistance on Thursday, but shares gapped down on Friday and sent it back below resistance. Unfortunately, shares are below the 100-day moving average. However, its holding a number of key moving averages at Fridayâs low â as well as the stockâs VWAP measure. Next week, support needs to continue holding for the bulls. However, a rotation over $277.90 â this weekâs high â would be bullish and put the 61.8% retracement in play near $281.50. Above that, and perhaps we can get a push up toward $290. However, on the downside, a break of those key moving averages would be discouraging. But a close below $254 would be really disheartening.

Related Quotes (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England flagged instances of illiquidity as a broader risk to the financial system after a rout in some government bond markets pushed yields higher.The comments in a routine assessment of threats to the financial system indicate concerns at the central bank that Governor Andrew Bailey has sought to play down. The bankâs Financial Policy Committee found that vulnerabilities in the market remain almost a year after they first emerged during a rout at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent appearances, Bailey has said that while officials are watching a surge in bond yields carefully, so far they viewed it as consistent with an improvement in economic outlook. The summary of the FPCâs March 18 meeting agreed with that assessment, but also highlighted risks to liquidity that were exposed by the sell off in debt markets in March 2020.âIn February, the fragile nature of liquidity in some government bond markets had been evident during a period where advanced economy government bond yields had risen markedly,â the BOE report said. âThe FPC judged that recent experience showed the fundamental vulnerabilities in market functioning that had been exposed during the âdash for cashâ remained and could amplify any further repricing.âThe central bank noted recent weak demand from non-dealers at U.S. Treasury auctions after a disastrous sale last month that helped push yields to a higher plane. Bonds have sold off around the globe in recent weeks, pushing U.K. yields to the highest levels since before the pandemic.The European Central Bank confronted the shift with a vow to speed up its own asset purchase program. BOE officials gave tacit approval to the increase in yields, declining to intervene in the market in their last decision on monetary policy on March 18.BOE policy makers also discussed:How online shopping and working from home will change the structure of the economy.The panel saw risks from weaker earnings prospects and insolvencies that are likely to rise from their current very low levelsThe FPC released details of previous discussions about the implications of a disorderly Brexit for open-ended commercial real estate funds.

The S&P 500 and Dow rose in a broad-based rally on Friday with technology, healthcare and financial stocks providing the biggest lift as investors bet on a recovery that is expected to deliver the fastest economic growth since 1984.  The S&P 500 and the Dow ended a seesaw week higher as investors rebalancing their portfolios at the quarter\\'s end continued to buy stocks that stand to benefit from a growing economy while they added some beaten-down technology shares.  The Nasdaq also ended higher as less popular tech shares advanced, but the composite index posted its second weekly decline in a row. Hiring the wrong financial advisor can wreak havoc on your investments and ruin your retirement. However, this new tool is changing everything. (Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation is set to be contained just above the Federal Reserveâs 2% target, and rising market interest rates are a sign of optimism about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.âOur forecast is for inflation to creep up to 2%, and our goal is to have it hit above 2% this year. Our forecast is around 2.1%, but we donât see it running out of control,â Harker said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee.Since January, longer-term interest rates have risen as investors have incorporated positive news on vaccine developments and the prospect for massive fiscal aid, factors which should speed the economic recovery. Thatâs translated into higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, but Harker brushed aside concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on growth.âGood SignââThis is a good sign, in some ways, that rates -- say, the 10-year -- is going up,â Harker said, referring to the 10-year Treasury yield. âPeople are more optimistic about the economy. Weâve been hovering at zero or negative neutral real rates for a while, so the fact that thatâs rising is a good sign because it shows optimism.âThe U.S. central bankâs Federal Open Market Committee, on which Harker sits but does not have a vote on policy decisions this year, published updated quarterly economic projections following its meeting last week. The projections were the first since December -- before the Democratic partyâs victory in January Senate races paved the way for more fiscal relief -- and they showed that Fed officials generally see inflation hovering just above the Fedâs 2% target over the next few years.Thatâs in line with the central bankâs new strategy unveiled last August, in which Fed officials will seek above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation, so that it averages 2% over time.âI am of the camp where we stick with our framework and we let inflation run above 2% for a while -- not out of control past 2%,â Harker said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Asda bosses have lost an equal pay fight with tens of thousands of store workers in a Supreme Court ruling in a \"watershed moment\" for the industry. More than 44,000 current and former workers, about two-thirds of whom are women, brought equal pay claims saying staff working in distribution depots, most of whom are men, are paid more. The Supreme Court backed an earlier Court of Appeal judgment that ruled store workers are entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff for equal pay purposes. The decision, a landmark precedent for the private sector, will send shockwaves through the industry, paving the way for compensation claims against other supermarkets totalling as much as Â£8bn. Equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue, but the ruling demonstrates that private sector firms are not immune and could open the floodgates to more claims. \"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those that have similar staffing models and pay structures,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood.

The company plans to price the offering on March 31 and list on the exchange April 9.Linklogisâs offering will test the appetite for first-time share sales after Hong Kongâs benchmark stock gauge slumped into a technical correction on Wednesday. Shares of internet giant Baidu Inc. ended flat in their debut in the city Tuesday and have fallen every day since.Linklogis provides technology solutions for supply chain finance in China. While Linklogisâs prospectus shows the firm hasnât made a profit in three years, it said sales from its supply chain finance solutions expanded 47% last year following an 83% surge in 2019.The share sale attracts six cornerstone investors who have agreed to subscribe a total of $365 million of stock, according to the filing. BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity will each buy $100 million of shares, while Janus Henderson Funds, The Ontario Teachersâ Pension Plan Board and Sequoia China will each purchase $50 million. Singaporeâs EDB Investments will snap up $15 million.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and China International Capital Corp. are joint sponsor of the deal.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P. Earlier this week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced that customers could now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Ark Invest\\'s Cathie Wood isnât so sure investors should use it as a means of payment. What Happened: In a webcast hosted by CBOE, Wood said that those that made profits from Bitcoinâs rally may be the subject of scrutiny by the IRS. The ARK Invest founder explained, \"The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don\\'t think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front.â Why It Matters: From a tax point of view, the IRS currently treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as âproperty,â as they do stocks and bonds. As a result, when investors sell their Bitcoin for fiat currency or use it as a means to purchase another good, they could be subject to massive capital gains taxes. Capital gains on taxes on assets that have been held for less than a year are taxed the same as a personâs âother income,â while assets that are held for longer than this period would be subject to long-term capital gains taxes ranging from 15-20%. While this would make any Tesla purchases with Bitcoin somewhat unfavorable for those that bought the cryptocurrency last year, more recent investors may actually benefit from the current rules. For instance, if an investor purchased the leading cryptocurrency at a higher price than its current value, he or she could actually report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the value of the asset. Price Action: After a volatile week, Bitcoin price recovered from yesterday\\'s low of $50,856 to $53,900 today. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $53,223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Stories Should you Buy a Tesla with BTC?

An unstoppable force is taking over our financial markets. But most Americans wonât see whatâs going on until itâs too late. Hereâs whatâs coming. Nowhere is this clearer than in Nigeria, where the central bank is so worried about Nigerians choosing cryptocurrencies over the naira for overseas remittance payments that it is now paying them to use official channels for those transfers instead.  The central bank announced the scheme after international remittances inflows plummeted last year, as more Nigerians abandoned official banking channels by turning to cheaper cryptocurrency exchanges.  The move came on the heels of a nationwide crackdown on banks dealing in cryptocurrencies, which the government enacted in an attempt to counteract the nairaâs declining value. For more than a year now, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has been ripping higher off of its pandemic lows. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday the stock market rally has been supported by four major pillars over the past year. Unfortunately, two of those pillars may now be cracking, putting the market at risk in the near-term. Essaye listed the following four bullish catalysts as pillars of the stock market rally over the past year. 1. Government stimulus. The U.S. government has already spent about $6 trillion in stimulus to prop up the economy throughout the pandemic downturn. The recent $1.9-trillion stimulus package will likely be the last one, and Essaye said this stock market pillar is now cracked. âBottom line, the outlook for government spending is turning much more mixed, because while there may be more spending (which is good for growth), itâs going to come with tax increases (which is bad for growth), and that mixed outlook is a departure from the past year (where it was all spending and no tax increases),â Essaye said. Related Link: Could Long-Term Capital Gains Selling Be Weighing On The Market? 2. Federal Reserve Accommodation. The Fed dropped its target fed funds interest rate range to between 0% and 0.25% and has been purchasing $120 billion in assets per month to help maintain a healthy credit market. Essaye said this pillar is now also cracked given a growing number of Fed officials said they see a rate hike coming in 2022 as of the Fedâs most recent dot plot projections. 3. Vaccine Optimism. Essaye said vaccine optimism has been a bullish catalyst throughout the rally, from positive critical trial data to FDA approvals to a U.S. vaccine rollout that\\'s now ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Essaye said financial markets have already priced in an end to the pandemic within the next few months, so it\\'s unclear how much stock market upside the vaccine rollout can provide moving forward. 4. No Double-Dip Recession. It seems like a lifetime ago that investors were concerned about a potential double-dip recession in 2020 or 2021. However, employment and earnings have been steadily trending in the right direction, and the chances of a double-dip recession appear extremely low at this point. Benzingaâs Take: The economy is well-positioned to bounce back aggressively in 2021. It remains to be seen if there is more upside to stock prices once support from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve are scaled back.

What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is âoff limits right nowâ as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors. Thill said that compared to other companies in the tech sector, Facebook is a âcheap name.â â$15 of earnings power and a mid 20 [P/E] multiple on it, and you are at $350 to $375 on the stock. So you got a lot of upside still on Facebook. We like that,â the analyst added.

Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) is down over 30% since it reached an all-time-high of $159.70 on Feb. 16, but options traders may be seeing more downside for Cathie Woodâs fund, which holds shares of companies that Wood feels are disruptive innovators. The ARKK Trades: At 2:09 p.m. Thursday a trader executed a put sweep of 7,238 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring April 16. The trade represented a $38,000 bearish bet for which the trader paid $5.25 per option contract. At 1:04 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 400 ARKK options with a $110 strike price expiring on Jan. 20, 2023. The trade represented a $1.4-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $26 per option contract. At 11:16 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,500 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring May 21. The trade represented a $2.49-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.60 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 819 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.35-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,028 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.7-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,087 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May 21. The trade represented a $1.78-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.40 per option contract. Together, traders are betting almost $8.76 million that the share price of ARKK is going lower. Why Itâs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating a large move in stock price will occur imminently. A sweeper pays market price for the call options, instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates âsmart moneyâ has entered into a position. About ARKK: Cathie Woodâs Ark ETFs have been wildly popular this year, and retail investors watch the fundâs activity daily to see which companies are being bought and sold. ARKK holds numerous stocks in this fund popular with retail traders such as Telsa Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Although ARKK holds some pharmaceuticals and biosciences companies, most of its holdings are in the tech sector, which is in a rout.

       "  \"Overall market sentiment has been high on Facebook, Inc. Common Stock (FB)  stock lately. FB receives a Bullish rating from InvestorsObserver's Stock Sentiment Indicator. Sentiment uses short term technical analysis to gauge whether a stock is desired by investors. As a technical indicator, it focuses on recent trends as opposed to the long term health of the underlying company. Updates for the company such as a earnings release can move the stock away from current trends. Price action is generally the best indicator of sentiment. For a stock to go up, investors must feel good about it. Similarly, a stock that is in a downtrend must be out of favor. InvestorsObserverâs Sentiment Indicator considers price action and recent trends in volume. Increasing volumes often mean that a trend is strengthening, while decreasing volumes can signal that a reversal could come soon. The options market is another place to get signals about sentiment. Since options allow investors to place bets on the price of a stock, we consider the ratio of calls and puts for stocks where options are available.  Facebook, Inc.

(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England flagged instances of illiquidity as a broader risk to the financial system after a rout in some government bond markets pushed yields higher.The comments in a routine assessment of threats to the financial system indicate concerns at the central bank that Governor Andrew Bailey has sought to play down. The bankâs Financial Policy Committee found that vulnerabilities in the market remain almost a year after they first emerged during a rout at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent appearances, Bailey has said that while officials are watching a surge in bond yields carefully, so far they viewed it as consistent with an improvement in economic outlook. The summary of the FPCâs March 18 meeting agreed with that assessment, but also highlighted risks to liquidity that were exposed by the sell off in debt markets in March 2020.âIn February, the fragile nature of liquidity in some government bond markets had been evident during a period where advanced economy government bond yields had risen markedly,â the BOE report said. âThe FPC judged that recent experience showed the fundamental vulnerabilities in market functioning that had been exposed during the âdash for cashâ remained and could amplify any further repricing.âThe central bank noted recent weak demand from non-dealers at U.S. Treasury auctions after a disastrous sale last month that helped push yields to a higher plane. Bonds have sold off around the globe in recent weeks, pushing U.K. yields to the highest levels since before the pandemic.The European Central Bank confronted the shift with a vow to speed up its own asset purchase program. BOE officials gave tacit approval to the increase in yields, declining to intervene in the market in their last decision on monetary policy on March 18.BOE policy makers also discussed:How online shopping and working from home will change the structure of the economy.The panel saw risks from weaker earnings prospects and insolvencies that are likely to rise from their current very low levelsThe FPC released details of previous discussions about the implications of a disorderly Brexit for open-ended commercial real estate funds. The group had been briefed that some may have to be suspended, as they were after the 2016 referendum, but opted to keep this out of the record until after the transition in case the comments themselves increased the riskRead More:Near-Disaster in U.S. Treasuries Lights a Fresh Fire for ReformGlobal Bond Rout Gains Steam Led by Treasuries in Flight to CashFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P. The S&P 500 and Dow rose in a broad-based rally on Friday with technology, healthcare and financial stocks providing the biggest lift as investors bet on a recovery that is expected to deliver the fastest economic growth since 1984.  The S&P 500 and the Dow ended a seesaw week higher as investors rebalancing their portfolios at the quarter\\'s end continued to buy stocks that stand to benefit from a growing economy while they added some beaten-down technology shares.  The Nasdaq also ended higher as less popular tech shares advanced, but the composite index posted its second weekly decline in a row. Hiring the wrong financial advisor can wreak havoc on your investments and ruin your retirement. However, this new tool is changing everything. (Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation is set to be contained just above the Federal Reserveâs 2% target, and rising market interest rates are a sign of optimism about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.âOur forecast is for inflation to creep up to 2%, and our goal is to have it hit above 2% this year. Our forecast is around 2.1%, but we donât see it running out of control,â Harker said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee.Since January, longer-term interest rates have risen as investors have incorporated positive news on vaccine developments and the prospect for massive fiscal aid, factors which should speed the economic recovery. Thatâs translated into higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, but Harker brushed aside concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on growth.âGood SignââThis is a good sign, in some ways, that rates -- say, the 10-year -- is going up,â Harker said, referring to the 10-year Treasury yield. âPeople are more optimistic about the economy. Weâve been hovering at zero or negative neutral real rates for a while, so the fact that thatâs rising is a good sign because it shows optimism.âThe U.S. central bankâs Federal Open Market Committee, on which Harker sits but does not have a vote on policy decisions this year, published updated quarterly economic projections following its meeting last week. The projections were the first since December -- before the Democratic partyâs victory in January Senate races paved the way for more fiscal relief -- and they showed that Fed officials generally see inflation hovering just above the Fedâs 2% target over the next few years.Thatâs in line with the central bankâs new strategy unveiled last August, in which Fed officials will seek above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation, so that it averages 2% over time.âI am of the camp where we stick with our framework and we let inflation run above 2% for a while -- not out of control past 2%,â Harker said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Asda bosses have lost an equal pay fight with tens of thousands of store workers in a Supreme Court ruling in a \"watershed moment\" for the industry. More than 44,000 current and former workers, about two-thirds of whom are women, brought equal pay claims saying staff working in distribution depots, most of whom are men, are paid more. The Supreme Court backed an earlier Court of Appeal judgment that ruled store workers are entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff for equal pay purposes. The decision, a landmark precedent for the private sector, will send shockwaves through the industry, paving the way for compensation claims against other supermarkets totalling as much as Â£8bn. Equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue, but the ruling demonstrates that private sector firms are not immune and could open the floodgates to more claims. \"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those that have similar staffing models and pay structures,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood.

Earlier this week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced that customers could now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Ark Invest\\'s Cathie Wood isnât so sure investors should use it as a means of payment. What Happened: In a webcast hosted by CBOE, Wood said that those that made profits from Bitcoinâs rally may be the subject of scrutiny by the IRS. The ARK Invest founder explained, \"The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don\\'t think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front.â Why It Matters: From a tax point of view, the IRS currently treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as âproperty,â as they do stocks and bonds. As a result, when investors sell their Bitcoin for fiat currency or use it as a means to purchase another good, they could be subject to massive capital gains taxes. Capital gains on taxes on assets that have been held for less than a year are taxed the same as a personâs âother income,â while assets that are held for longer than this period would be subject to long-term capital gains taxes ranging from 15-20%. While this would make any Tesla purchases with Bitcoin somewhat unfavorable for those that bought the cryptocurrency last year, more recent investors may actually benefit from the current rules. For instance, if an investor purchased the leading cryptocurrency at a higher price than its current value, he or she could actually report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the value of the asset. Price Action: After a volatile week, Bitcoin price recovered from yesterday\\'s low of $50,856 to $53,900 today. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $53,223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Stories Should you Buy a Tesla with BTC?

An unstoppable force is taking over our financial markets. But most Americans wonât see whatâs going on until itâs too late. Hereâs whatâs coming. Nowhere is this clearer than in Nigeria, where the central bank is so worried about Nigerians choosing cryptocurrencies over the naira for overseas remittance payments that it is now paying them to use official channels for those transfers instead.  The central bank announced the scheme after international remittances inflows plummeted last year, as more Nigerians abandoned official banking channels by turning to cheaper cryptocurrency exchanges.  The move came on the heels of a nationwide crackdown on banks dealing in cryptocurrencies, which the government enacted in an attempt to counteract the nairaâs declining value. For more than a year now, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has been ripping higher off of its pandemic lows. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday the stock market rally has been supported by four major pillars over the past year. Unfortunately, two of those pillars may now be cracking, putting the market at risk in the near-term. Essaye listed the following four bullish catalysts as pillars of the stock market rally over the past year. 1. Government stimulus. The U.S. government has already spent about $6 trillion in stimulus to prop up the economy throughout the pandemic downturn. The recent $1.9-trillion stimulus package will likely be the last one, and Essaye said this stock market pillar is now cracked. âBottom line, the outlook for government spending is turning much more mixed, because while there may be more spending (which is good for growth), itâs going to come with tax increases (which is bad for growth), and that mixed outlook is a departure from the past year (where it was all spending and no tax increases),â Essaye said. Related Link: Could Long-Term Capital Gains Selling Be Weighing On The Market? 2. Federal Reserve Accommodation. The Fed dropped its target fed funds interest rate range to between 0% and 0.25% and has been purchasing $120 billion in assets per month to help maintain a healthy credit market. Essaye said this pillar is now also cracked given a growing number of Fed officials said they see a rate hike coming in 2022 as of the Fedâs most recent dot plot projections. 3. Vaccine Optimism. Essaye said vaccine optimism has been a bullish catalyst throughout the rally, from positive critical trial data to FDA approvals to a U.S. vaccine rollout that\\'s now ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Essaye said financial markets have already priced in an end to the pandemic within the next few months, so it\\'s unclear how much stock market upside the vaccine rollout can provide moving forward. 4. No Double-Dip Recession. It seems like a lifetime ago that investors were concerned about a potential double-dip recession in 2020 or 2021. However, employment and earnings have been steadily trending in the right direction, and the chances of a double-dip recession appear extremely low at this point. Benzingaâs Take: The economy is well-positioned to bounce back aggressively in 2021. It remains to be seen if there is more upside to stock prices once support from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve are scaled back.

(NASDAQ: FB). What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is âoff limits right nowâ as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors. Thill said that compared to other companies in the tech sector, Facebook is a âcheap name.â â$15 of earnings power and a mid 20 [P/E] multiple on it, and you are at $350 to $375 on the stock. So you got a lot of upside still on Facebook. We like that,â the analyst added.

Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) is down over 30% since it reached an all-time-high of $159.70 on Feb. 16, but options traders may be seeing more downside for Cathie Woodâs fund, which holds shares of companies that Wood feels are disruptive innovators. The ARKK Trades: At 2:09 p.m. Thursday a trader executed a put sweep of 7,238 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring April 16. The trade represented a $38,000 bearish bet for which the trader paid $5.25 per option contract. At 1:04 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 400 ARKK options with a $110 strike price expiring on Jan. 20, 2023. The trade represented a $1.4-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $26 per option contract. At 11:16 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,500 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring May 21. The trade represented a $2.49-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.60 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 819 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.35-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,028 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May. 21.

At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,087 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May 21. The trade represented a $1.78-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.40 per option contract. Together, traders are betting almost $8.76 million that the share price of ARKK is going lower. Why Itâs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating a large move in stock price will occur imminently. A sweeper pays market price for the call options, instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates âsmart moneyâ has entered into a position. About ARKK: Cathie Woodâs Ark ETFs have been wildly popular this year, and retail investors watch the fundâs activity daily to see which companies are being bought and sold. ARKK holds numerous stocks in this fund popular with retail traders such as Telsa Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Although ARKK holds some pharmaceuticals and biosciences companies, most of its holdings are in the tech sector, which is in a rout.

Related Quotes (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, part of an extraordinary spree of selling that erased $35 billion from the values of bellwether stocks ranging from Chinese technology giants to U.S. media conglomerates.The Wall Street bank sold $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu Inc., Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. before the market opened in the U.S, according to an email to clients seen by Bloomberg News.That move was followed by the sale of $3.9 billion of shares in ViacomCBS Inc., Discovery Inc., Farfetch Ltd., iQiyi Inc. and GSX Techedu Inc., the email said.More of the unregistered stock offerings were said to be managed by Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the matter, on behalf of one or more undisclosed shareholders. Some of the trades exceeded $1 billion in individual companies, calculations based on Bloomberg data show.Wall Street is now collectively speculating on the identity of the mysterious seller or sellers. The liquidation triggered price swings for every stock involved in the high-volume transactions, rattling traders and prompting talk that a hedge fund or family office was in trouble and being forced to sell.Several major investment banks with ties to hedge fund Archegos Capital Management LLC liquidated holdings, contributing to the slump in share prices of ViacomCBS and Discovery, IPO Edge reported, citing people it didnât identify. CNBC reported forced sales by Archegos were probably related to margin calls on heavily leveraged positions. Archegos is controlled by former Julian Robertson protege and Tiger Management analyst Bill Hwang.Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegosâs New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasnât returned. Price SwingsIn block trades, large volumes of securities are privately negotiated between parties, usually outside of open market.Fridayâs selloff dragged companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and NetEase Inc. lower. The peers later recovered after traders said word of the offerings lessened fears that a broader trade was unfolding throughout the sector.That late rebound pushed up an index of companies engaged in internet-related businesses in China and the U.S., with the measure halting a three-day selloff while still notching a slide of about 6.5% for the week.Chinese stocks have been under pressure after a warning from the Securities and Exchange Commission that itâs taking steps to force accounting firms to let U.S. regulators review the financial audits of overseas companies -- the penalty for non-compliance being ejection from exchanges. In addition to that, Bloomberg News reported that Chinaâs government has proposed forming a joint venture with local technology giants that would oversee the lucrative data they collect.Read more: ViacomCBS, Discovery Plunge on New Downgrade, Block Trades(Updates with the search for the mysterious seller in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

In a volatile market environment, with stocks getting buffeted about by a variety of conflicting forces, investors are looking to the expert commentators for some guidance. Covering the macro situation from banking giant JPMorgan, quant strategist Marko Kolanovic believes that weâre in for continued gains in stocks. Kolanovic doesnât dismiss the recent dips in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ; rather, he sees them as temporary. Kolanovic points out that weâre approaching the end of Q1 and will soon see the first earnings reports of 2021. He expects that to build momentum for stocks going into the summer, boosting the market indexes and keeping inflation at a steady state with bond yields stabilizing. Kolanovic has set a 4,400 year-end price target for the S&P 500, which suggests ~13% growth in the marketâs benchmark index. Taking Kolanovicâs outlook to heart, J.P. Morgan analysts are offering up concrete recommendations, pointing to two names that look compelling. As the firmâs analysts are forecasting at least 30% upside potential for each, we used TipRanksâ database to dig a bit deeper. BorgWarner, Inc. (BWA) The first JPM pick we\\'re looking at is BorgWarner, a major manufacturer of drivetrain components, especially transmissions and air management systems, which has long been a stalwart of Detroitâs automotive industry. The company has, in recent years, been a leader in the development of powertrains and motors for electric vehicles, and is committed to accelerating that development. The company announced this week that it intends to expand its EV revenues to 45% of the company total by 2030. The companyâs plan, called Charging Forward, would see a focus on developing componentry for electric commercial vehicles while optimizing the combustion portfolio, and scaling the EV business up to deliver the projected higher demand. Management expects to maintain BorgWarnerâs high margin performance while generating a strong free cash flow. Current performance gives BorgWarner a solid foundation for its ambitious EV plans. The company saw a strong beat in 4Q20 on several key metrics. BWA reported revenues of $3.93 billion, a 53% gain year-over-year. EPS came in at $1.52, up from $1.06 in the year-ago quarter. Turning to full-year numbers, 2020 ended with BWA showing $10.17 billion at the top line, about equal to last yearâs total. 2020 earnings were down, to $2.34 from $3.61 in 2019. Despite the lower earnings, BWAâs cash position improved in 2020. Free cash flow was $743 million for the year, and the company increased its cash and cash equivalent holdings by $818 million year-over-year. Among the bulls is JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman who wrote: âDemand for BWA products is strong, driven by both consumer âpullâ and government âpushâ elements, and we believe will only increase over time as the rising amount of vehicles in emerging markets upwardly pressures fuel prices. BWA already enjoys the second-highest margins in the sector, in part driven by the fact that many of the products it manufactures are of a highly engineered nature, leading to high technical barriers to entry and market concentration. Still, we expect the combination of rapid top-line growth and financial discipline to allow for top-tier operating margin expansion.â To this end, Brinkman rates BWA an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $58 price target implies a potential upside of 33% for the coming year. (To watch Brinkmanâs track record, click here) Brinkman is not an outlier in his bullish stance, but there is some division on Wall Street regarding BWA. The analyst consensus view is a Moderate Buy, based on 14 recent reviews breaking down to 8 Buys, 5 Holds and 1 Sell. The shares are priced at $43.70 and their $49.69 average price target suggests a one-year upside of ~14%. (See BWA stock analysis on TipRanks) Adobe, Inc. (ADBE) Shifting gears, weâll move from automotive to software. Adobe is a name weâre all familiar with, and rightly so. The company created the PDF format, and among its product line-up are Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, among many, many others. In recent years, Adobe has shifted to a subscription SaaS model, offering its products as a bundle on Adobe Creative Cloud. Adobe saw gains last year, as its cloud-based model was well suited to 2020âs shift to remote work and telecommuting. The companyâs fiscal 2020 revenues hit $12.8 billion, up nearly 14% from 2019, and growth has continued into its first quarter of fiscal 2021. The company reported $3.9 billion in Q1âs top line, a company record and up 26% year-over-year. EPS, at $2.61 per share, was up 33% yoy. That guidance was updated based on the Q1 results. Management sees the company bringing in $15.45 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2021, which would represent a 20% yoy increase from the published 2020 figure. Digital media, a major driver of the 2020 numbers, is expected to deliver 22% yoy growth and show annualized recurring revenue of $1.8 billion. Covering this stock for JPM is 5-star analyst Sterling Auty, who sees a clear path forward for Adobe. âWhen the economic cycle turns for the better companies tend to invest in solutions that will help drive revenue growth and that is exactly what the Adobe Experience Cloud, with its digital marketing solutions, can help customers achieve,â Auty noted. The analyst added, \"Over the years it is more common for Adobe to reiterate the full-year guidance after reporting the first-quarter earnings, so seeing the raise above just the first quarter upside for the full year numbers is a sign of incremental strength in our opinion. As a reminder, the stock has not done a lot since the start of September and this might be the catalyst to get it moving again.\" In line with his bullish comments, Auty rates ADBE shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy). His $595 price target indicates his confidence in a 32% one-year upside. (To watch Autyâs track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street analysts are pretty well unified in their views on Adobe â the stock has 16 Buy reviews, against a single Hold, for a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The shares are priced at $450.99, with an average price target, $559.82, suggesting an upside of ~24% by yearâs end.

It is very important to do your own analysis before making any investment. President Biden signed the bill weeks ago, so why haven\\'t you gotten your money? As vaccines continue to be administered in higher quantities and huge portions of the economy begin to reopen, investors are trying to determine how they should invest in a post-pandemic world. With tech stocks dropping and the market\\'s momentum cycling toward value investments, it\\'s clear that all eyes are on beaten-down sectors that promise big profits in an economic recovery. An unstoppable force is taking over our financial markets. But most Americans wonât see whatâs going on until itâs too late. Hereâs whatâs coming. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) recently introduced an estate tax plan that specifically lists the wealthiest Americans. Rumors of massive block trades have followed gyrations in the stock prices of some companies on Friday. A block trade involves a large number of shares and is privately negotiated between buyer and seller. Here is the latest on what may have transpired: IPO Edge reported late on Friday that \"several major investment banks\" with ties to Archegos Capital Management began liquidating holdings on Friday and helped push down the share prices of Discovery, Inc. and ViacomCBS Inc. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) offered over 30 million shares of ViacomCBS, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) offered over 15 million shares of Discovery in block trades on Friday, IPO Edge said, citing people familiar with the matter. After Archegos was unable to meet a margin call from an investment bank, that bank began selling off stakes held by Archegos, according to one unnamed source cited by IPO Edge. It is not clear which bank that may have been â IPO Edge said it wasn\\'t necessarily Goldman or Morgan Stanley. Archegos Capital Management is led by Bill Hwang. It held and may still have large holdings of ViacomCBS and Discovery, according to IPO Edge. Hwang was the founder of Tiger Asia Management LLC, which no longer is in business. Shares of ViacomCBS, which trade under the name CBS Corporation Common Stock (NASDAQ: VIAC), ended Friday\\'s trading down 27.31% at $48.23, after bottoming at $39.81. DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS INC. (NASDAQ: DISCA) shares fell 27.45% to $41.90 after bottoming at $34.60 on Friday. Bloomberg reported today that Goldman Sachs sold $10.5 billion worth of stocks through block trades that were \"part of an extraordinary spree of selling that erased $35 billion from the values of bellwether stocks ranging from Chinese technology giants to U.S. media conglomerates.\" Bloomberg cited people familiar with the matter, along with an email to Goldman clients that the financial news outlet saw. Bloomberg said Goldman sold $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU), Tencent Music Entertainment Group (NYSE: TME) and Vipshop Holdings Ltd (NYSE: VIPS) before U.S. markets opened. Then Goldman sold $3.9 billion of shares in ViacomCBS Inc., Discovery Inc., Farfetch Ltd (NYSE: FTCH), IQIYI Inc (NASDAQ: IQ) and GSX Techedu Inc (NYSE: GSX). Additional offerings may have come from Morgan Stanley, on behalf of one or more shareholders, with some individual trades exceeding $1 billion, Bloomberg reported. Baidu shares dropped more than 16% to $174.05 during Friday\\'s trading before recovering for a 1.97% gain at $208.61. Shares of Chinese companies traded on U.S. exchanges took a general hit on Friday amid concerns of delisting as the tensions between Washington and Beijing show no sign of letting up.

All rights reserved. They say that politics are downstream from culture â but so are the stock markets. And sometimes, culture informs our investment decisions in ways that we could never have predicted just a decade earlier. The electric vehicle sector is one such sector, in the early stages of its takeoff. EVs are more than just the flagship of an environmentalistâs wish list. They are the showboats of new automotive technology, promising several advantages over internal combustion technology: cleaner vehicles, higher performance, and a revolution in battery technology that will certainly carry over into the broader economy. With all of that behind it, itâs no wonder that 5-star analyst Tate Sullivan, of Maxim Group, sees current conditions offering an opportunity to buy into EV stocks. He notes that EV companies in his coverage universe have been executing well on consistent expansion strategies, building up both production capacity and distribution networks. Sullivan is especially bullish on two EV stocks, noting that each could climb over 100% higher in the year ahead. Using TipRanksâ database, we did a deep dive into the data to find out what makes both so attractive. Beam Global (BEEM) First up of Sullivanâs picks is Beam Global, a solar tech company that focuses on creating charging solution for electric vehicles and drones. Beamâs flagship product is the EV ARC (electric vehicle autonomous renewable charger), a solar powered, stand alone charging station that fits into standard parking spaces and is compatible with most models of electric vehicle. The EV ARC operates off the grid, increasing its installation flexibility â and its reliability. Beam boasts that the EV ARC can be installed without construction permits in just a few minutes, an advantage conferred directly by its independent, off-the-grid design. Additionally, the charging units can be easily moved should the customer need to relocate. These attributes make the system attractive to fleet customers, and Beam lists over two dozen California municipalities and State government agencies on its customer list. Earlier this year, Beam announced that it saw record deliveries in 4Q20, with 33 EV ARC systems delivered and installed during the quarter. This was more than any previous Q4, and more than the three previous quarters of 2020. Looking at Beam, Sullivan believes that the companyâs success in delivering is sustainable, noting, \"BEEM can support larger orders from its current manufacturing facility by adding workers and shifts.â The analyst added, âWe continue to expect BEEM shares will anticipate large orders for the company\\'s primary clean energy EV charging infrastructure product, the EV ARC. While many other companies in the EV market are developing products, factories, and supply chains, BEEM already has revenue, repeat customers, and a plan to significantly increase capacity.â In line with his optimistic approach, Sullivan rates BEEM a Buy along with a $90 price target. This figure implies a 124% upside from current levels. (To watch Sullivanâs track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 2 Buys and 1 Hold have been issued in the last three months. Therefore, BEEM gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Based on the $69.33 average price target, shares could surge ~72% in the next year. (See BEEN stock analysis on TipRanks) GreenPower Motor (GP) From innovations in charging infrastructure, weâll switch over to actual EVs. GreenPower Motor is a maker of commercial electric vehicles, with a line of busses marketed to school districts and urban mass transit systems, as well as cargo vans fit for light hauling duties. The companyâs prime product is the EV Star, an adaptable electric drive cab and chassis capable of modification into truck, van, or bus configurations. GreenPower also builds and markets full size, low-ride transit busses of more conventional design. GreenPower is based in Vancouver, Canada, and boasts a strong customer base in the state of California. The California state government has directed that, by 2035, all new vehicles sold in the state must be zero-emission; this opens up a large market for companies like GreenPower, and the company currently boasts Sacramento Regional Transit, the Port of Oakland, and the University of California system among its customers. Sullivan points out that âGP has already announced plans to increase monthly production of electric school buses and shuttle vans ahead of larger orders,â and to expand its manufacturing facilities. The company reported having 95 vehicles âcompleted but not deliveredâ or in production at the end of Q4, and is seeing increased customer orders. Recent new customers include Zeem Solutions, an e-mobility logistics company that ordered 30 EV Star vans, and Washington Stateâs Grant Transit Authority, which ordered four wireless-charging EV Stars. In February, GP announced an agreement to provide up to 150 EV Star cab and chassis units to Forest River, Inc., a maker of cutaway bus, motorhomes, and trucks. Referring to the Forest River agreement, Sullivan wrote, âWe believe this order will help GP secure orders from other EV customers. In addition to announcing this order, GP believes its current monthly production of EV Star and electric school buses can lead to $75M of annual revenue.â To this end, the Maxim analyst rates the stock a Buy, and his $45 price target indicates room for 125% growth in the next 12 months. Judging by the consensus breakdown, opinions are anything but mixed. With 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that GP is a Strong Buy. At $41, the average price target implies 116% upside potential.

For investors seeking a strong growth option, and willing to take on some added risk, the biotech sector offers an unparalleled opportunity. Unlike other names, biotech companies often rely on only a few key milestones like data readouts or FDA approvals. So, when a particular result goes a companyâs way, the news can act as a catalyst that sends shares soaring. However, investors looking to gain exposure to this space should know that this also makes these stocks riskier as unfavorable outcomes can have the opposite effect. As a result, the strength of investment opportunities in this sector can be harder to determine. So whatâs the best way to gauge biotech stocks ahead of big catalysts? We suggest turning to Wall Street analysts for guidance. Using TipRanks database, we were able to identify two such stocks as they approach significant catalysts. The platform also revealed that these Strong Buy tickers boast impressive upside potential from current levels. Ardelyx (ARDX) We\\'ll start with Ardelyx, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments to improve the management of complications arising from kidney and cardiorenal diseases. This is a niche with a large patient base, and one that has to some extent been overlooked in the medical research industry. Ardelyx has created tenapanor, a targeted small molecule therapy. This first-in-class drug candidate is under investigation for its use in controlling serum phosphorus in adult dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease. Ardelyx believes that tenapanor makes it possible to achieve effective and consistent control of blood phosphate levels. So far, tenapanor has met its primary endpoint in three Phase 3 clinical trials. The trials evaluated the drug candidateâs efficacy and safety; two (BLOCK and FREEDOM) were monotherapy trials with adults CKD patients undergoing dialysis, while the third (AMPLIFY) was a dual mechanism trial. Ardelyx currently has an open label extension trial underway. The positive results from the Phase 3 studies form the background to the companyâs New Drug Application to the FDA. This is a key milestone in the development and approval process. The key date is April 29, 2021 â this is the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for tenapanor. Ahead of the upcoming PDUFA date, Wedbush analyst Laura Chico believes a successful outcome is in the cards. âSimply put, we see lead asset tenapanor as novel and differentiated, with the potential to disrupt hyperphosphatemia treatment in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis. The novel mechanism, robust serum phosphate lowering comparable to marketed phosphate binders and a lower pill burden creates a differentiated profile. Small-cap commercial launches are not for the faint of heart, but we see tenapanor\\'s profile resonating with physicians. With the pipeline a call option, we presume an on-time approval (PDUFA 4/29/21) and 3Q21 launch,â Chico opined. In line with her comments, Chico rates ARDX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and her $14 target implies a one-year upside of 129%. (To watch Chicoâs track record, click here) That Wall Street likes this stock is clear from the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. That consensus is built on 4 recent Buy reviews, which is good news for Ardelyx. The shares are priced at $6.10 and their $14 average price target matches Chicoâs. (See ARDX stock analysis on TipRanks) Heron Therapeutics (HRTX) The second biopharma company weâre looking at here, Heron, starts with a leg up â it has two drugs already approved by the FDA and on the market. Heronâs two approved drugs, Sustol and Cinvanti, are both indicated for use in treating the nausea that is frequently caused by chemotherapy. This is a serious side effect that has a distinct negative effect on the quality of life of many cancer patients â even when the chemo is effective. An efficacious anti-nausea drug should be a net boon for the company, and Heron expects that sales of the two drugs in 2021 should total $130 million to $145 million. The major catalyst for the company, however, is the upcoming PDUFA date for HDX-011 (Zynrelef). HDX-011 is indicated for use to control postoperative pain in small to medium surgical wounds in adults. It was granted a marketing authorization by the European Commission in September 2020, and the next milestone is the PDUFA date for FDA approval, currently set for May 12, 2021. Heronâs initial application was submitted in October 2018 and was followed by a complete response letter (CRL) in April of 2019. The CRL requested additional non-clinical and CMC data. The NDA was resubmitted in October of 2019, followed by a second CRL in June 2020 seeking additional non-clinical information. The third time\\'s the charm? Stifel analyst Derek Archila believes so. âWe continue to like shares and think there is upside on the approval of HTX-011 (postoperative pain) which is expected in May 2021. While HTX-011 has been hampered by two CRLs already, we think the approval in the EU offers de-risking on the clinical efficacy and safety front and that the minor issues that the FDA has raised around the excipients used should be addressable. On approval, we think shares could move to the low-to-mid$20 range,\" Archila commented. Archilaâs upbeat outlook on Heron manifests with a Buy rating and a $28 price target that suggests room for 87% growth in the next 12 months. (To watch Archilaâs track record, click here) Once again, weâre looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus view. Heron has 3 recent Buy ratings, and an average price target that is somewhat more bullish than Archila allows; at $30.33, it implies a potential upside of ~103% on the one-year time horizon.

Related Quotes (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England flagged instances of illiquidity as a broader risk to the financial system after a rout in some government bond markets pushed yields higher.The comments in a routine assessment of threats to the financial system indicate concerns at the central bank that Governor Andrew Bailey has sought to play down. The bankâs Financial Policy Committee found that vulnerabilities in the market remain almost a year after they first emerged during a rout at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent appearances, Bailey has said that while officials are watching a surge in bond yields carefully, so far they viewed it as consistent with an improvement in economic outlook. The summary of the FPCâs March 18 meeting agreed with that assessment, but also highlighted risks to liquidity that were exposed by the sell off in debt markets in March 2020.âIn February, the fragile nature of liquidity in some government bond markets had been evident during a period where advanced economy government bond yields had risen markedly,â the BOE report said. âThe FPC judged that recent experience showed the fundamental vulnerabilities in market functioning that had been exposed during the âdash for cashâ remained and could amplify any further repricing.âThe central bank noted recent weak demand from non-dealers at U.S. Treasury auctions after a disastrous sale last month that helped push yields to a higher plane.

The S&P 500 and Dow rose in a broad-based rally on Friday with technology, healthcare and financial stocks providing the biggest lift as investors bet on a recovery that is expected to deliver the fastest economic growth since 1984.  The S&P 500 and the Dow ended a seesaw week higher as investors rebalancing their portfolios at the quarter\\'s end continued to buy stocks that stand to benefit from a growing economy while they added some beaten-down technology shares.

(Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation is set to be contained just above the Federal Reserveâs 2% target, and rising market interest rates are a sign of optimism about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.âOur forecast is for inflation to creep up to 2%, and our goal is to have it hit above 2% this year. Our forecast is around 2.1%, but we donât see it running out of control,â Harker said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee.Since January, longer-term interest rates have risen as investors have incorporated positive news on vaccine developments and the prospect for massive fiscal aid, factors which should speed the economic recovery. Thatâs translated into higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, but Harker brushed aside concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on growth.âGood SignââThis is a good sign, in some ways, that rates -- say, the 10-year -- is going up,â Harker said, referring to the 10-year Treasury yield. âPeople are more optimistic about the economy. Weâve been hovering at zero or negative neutral real rates for a while, so the fact that thatâs rising is a good sign because it shows optimism.âThe U.S. central bankâs Federal Open Market Committee, on which Harker sits but does not have a vote on policy decisions this year, published updated quarterly economic projections following its meeting last week. The projections were the first since December -- before the Democratic partyâs victory in January Senate races paved the way for more fiscal relief -- and they showed that Fed officials generally see inflation hovering just above the Fedâs 2% target over the next few years.Thatâs in line with the central bankâs new strategy unveiled last August, in which Fed officials will seek above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation, so that it averages 2% over time.âI am of the camp where we stick with our framework and we let inflation run above 2% for a while -- not out of control past 2%,â Harker said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

The mammoth cargo ship marooned in the Suez Canal has the potential to inflict damage on a global economy still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. An unstoppable force is taking over our financial markets. But most Americans wonât see whatâs going on until itâs too late. Hereâs whatâs coming. Asda bosses have lost an equal pay fight with tens of thousands of store workers in a Supreme Court ruling in a \"watershed moment\" for the industry. More than 44,000 current and former workers, about two-thirds of whom are women, brought equal pay claims saying staff working in distribution depots, most of whom are men, are paid more. The Supreme Court backed an earlier Court of Appeal judgment that ruled store workers are entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff for equal pay purposes. The decision, a landmark precedent for the private sector, will send shockwaves through the industry, paving the way for compensation claims against other supermarkets totalling as much as Â£8bn. Equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue, but the ruling demonstrates that private sector firms are not immune and could open the floodgates to more claims. \"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those that have similar staffing models and pay structures,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood. Items that protect you from the virus are medical expenses, the tax agency says. The dominant narrative around U.S. small businesses throughout the pandemic has been one of doom and gloom.  The good news is that these businesses have some very attractive financing options through the Small Business Administration (SBA) thanks to the stimulus package passed in December.  The bill enhanced three key loan programs that are part of the SBAâs traditional offerings, creating very generous lending terms.

(Bloomberg) -- Chinese fintech company Linklogis Inc., backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., is seeking to raise HK$8.3 billion ($1.07 billion) from an initial public offering in Hong Kong.The Shenzhen-based company is selling 452.9 million shares at HK$16.28 to HK$18.28 apiece, according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Friday. The company plans to price the offering on March 31 and list on the exchange April 9.Linklogisâs offering will test the appetite for first-time share sales after Hong Kongâs benchmark stock gauge slumped into a technical correction on Wednesday. Shares of internet giant Baidu Inc. ended flat in their debut in the city Tuesday and have fallen every day since.Linklogis provides technology solutions for supply chain finance in China.

Earlier this week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced that customers could now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Ark Invest\\'s Cathie Wood isnât so sure investors should use it as a means of payment. What Happened: In a webcast hosted by CBOE, Wood said that those that made profits from Bitcoinâs rally may be the subject of scrutiny by the IRS. The ARK Invest founder explained, \"The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don\\'t think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front.â Why It Matters: From a tax point of view, the IRS currently treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as âproperty,â as they do stocks and bonds. As a result, when investors sell their Bitcoin for fiat currency or use it as a means to purchase another good, they could be subject to massive capital gains taxes. Capital gains on taxes on assets that have been held for less than a year are taxed the same as a personâs âother income,â while assets that are held for longer than this period would be subject to long-term capital gains taxes ranging from 15-20%. While this would make any Tesla purchases with Bitcoin somewhat unfavorable for those that bought the cryptocurrency last year, more recent investors may actually benefit from the current rules. For instance, if an investor purchased the leading cryptocurrency at a higher price than its current value, he or she could actually report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the value of the asset. Price Action: After a volatile week, Bitcoin price recovered from yesterday\\'s low of $50,856 to $53,900 today. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $53,223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Stories Should you Buy a Tesla with BTC?

Once we see certain \\'elements\\' we look for in these types of companies, history has shown us unprecedented gains, and they usually come quick. Nowhere is this clearer than in Nigeria, where the central bank is so worried about Nigerians choosing cryptocurrencies over the naira for overseas remittance payments that it is now paying them to use official channels for those transfers instead.  The central bank announced the scheme after international remittances inflows plummeted last year, as more Nigerians abandoned official banking channels by turning to cheaper cryptocurrency exchanges.  The move came on the heels of a nationwide crackdown on banks dealing in cryptocurrencies, which the government enacted in an attempt to counteract the nairaâs declining value. For more than a year now, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has been ripping higher off of its pandemic lows. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday the stock market rally has been supported by four major pillars over the past year. Unfortunately, two of those pillars may now be cracking, putting the market at risk in the near-term. Essaye listed the following four bullish catalysts as pillars of the stock market rally over the past year. 1. Government stimulus. The U.S. government has already spent about $6 trillion in stimulus to prop up the economy throughout the pandemic downturn. The recent $1.9-trillion stimulus package will likely be the last one, and Essaye said this stock market pillar is now cracked. âBottom line, the outlook for government spending is turning much more mixed, because while there may be more spending (which is good for growth), itâs going to come with tax increases (which is bad for growth), and that mixed outlook is a departure from the past year (where it was all spending and no tax increases),â Essaye said. Related Link: Could Long-Term Capital Gains Selling Be Weighing On The Market? 2. Federal Reserve Accommodation. The Fed dropped its target fed funds interest rate range to between 0% and 0.25% and has been purchasing $120 billion in assets per month to help maintain a healthy credit market. Essaye said this pillar is now also cracked given a growing number of Fed officials said they see a rate hike coming in 2022 as of the Fedâs most recent dot plot projections. 3. Vaccine Optimism. Essaye said vaccine optimism has been a bullish catalyst throughout the rally, from positive critical trial data to FDA approvals to a U.S. vaccine rollout that\\'s now ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Essaye said financial markets have already priced in an end to the pandemic within the next few months, so it\\'s unclear how much stock market upside the vaccine rollout can provide moving forward. 4. No Double-Dip Recession. It seems like a lifetime ago that investors were concerned about a potential double-dip recession in 2020 or 2021. However, employment and earnings have been steadily trending in the right direction, and the chances of a double-dip recession appear extremely low at this point. Benzingaâs Take: The economy is well-positioned to bounce back aggressively in 2021. It remains to be seen if there is more upside to stock prices once support from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve are scaled back.

What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is âoff limits right nowâ as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors.

Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) is down over 30% since it reached an all-time-high of $159.70 on Feb. 16, but options traders may be seeing more downside for Cathie Woodâs fund, which holds shares of companies that Wood feels are disruptive innovators. The ARKK Trades: At 2:09 p.m. Thursday a trader executed a put sweep of 7,238 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring April 16. The trade represented a $38,000 bearish bet for which the trader paid $5.25 per option contract. At 1:04 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 400 ARKK options with a $110 strike price expiring on Jan. 20, 2023. The trade represented a $1.4-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $26 per option contract. At 11:16 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,500 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring May 21. The trade represented a $2.49-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.60 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 819 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.35-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,028 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.7-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,087 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May 21. The trade represented a $1.78-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.40 per option contract. Together, traders are betting almost $8.76 million that the share price of ARKK is going lower. Why Itâs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating a large move in stock price will occur imminently. A sweeper pays market price for the call options, instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates âsmart moneyâ has entered into a position. About ARKK: Cathie Woodâs Ark ETFs have been wildly popular this year, and retail investors watch the fundâs activity daily to see which companies are being bought and sold. ARKK holds numerous stocks in this fund popular with retail traders such as Telsa Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Although ARKK holds some pharmaceuticals and biosciences companies, most of its holdings are in the tech sector, which is in a rout.

Despite regulatory scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and state attorneys, Alphabet\\'s strong quarterly report drove its share price higher. Results of the company\\'s search service andYouTube strongly exceeded expectations driven by increasing advertising that resulted from a strengthening economy. The revenue acceleration occurred across geographies and in Alphabet\\'s cloud computing service as well. Earnings exhibited strong operating leverage as costs moved only slightly higher. Finally, the share price of Alphabet responded favorably to an anti-trust lawsuit filed by the DOJ against the company because the litigation was more limited in scope than anticipated, primarily alleging that the company has improperly established agreements with various phone makers, including Apple, to ensure that Google isthe default search engine across devices.\" Yeamake / Shutterstock.com Our calculations show that Alphabet Inc.

Related Quotes (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England flagged instances of illiquidity as a broader risk to the financial system after a rout in some government bond markets pushed yields higher.The comments in a routine assessment of threats to the financial system indicate concerns at the central bank that Governor Andrew Bailey has sought to play down. The bankâs Financial Policy Committee found that vulnerabilities in the market remain almost a year after they first emerged during a rout at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent appearances, Bailey has said that while officials are watching a surge in bond yields carefully, so far they viewed it as consistent with an improvement in economic outlook. The summary of the FPCâs March 18 meeting agreed with that assessment, but also highlighted risks to liquidity that were exposed by the sell off in debt markets in March 2020.âIn February, the fragile nature of liquidity in some government bond markets had been evident during a period where advanced economy government bond yields had risen markedly,â the BOE report said. âThe FPC judged that recent experience showed the fundamental vulnerabilities in market functioning that had been exposed during the âdash for cashâ remained and could amplify any further repricing.âThe central bank noted recent weak demand from non-dealers at U.S. Treasury auctions after a disastrous sale last month that helped push yields to a higher plane. Bonds have sold off around the globe in recent weeks, pushing U.K. yields to the highest levels since before the pandemic.The European Central Bank confronted the shift with a vow to speed up its own asset purchase program. BOE officials gave tacit approval to the increase in yields, declining to intervene in the market in their last decision on monetary policy on March 18.BOE policy makers also discussed:How online shopping and working from home will change the structure of the economy.The panel saw risks from weaker earnings prospects and insolvencies that are likely to rise from their current very low levelsThe FPC released details of previous discussions about the implications of a disorderly Brexit for open-ended commercial real estate funds.

The S&P 500 and Dow rose in a broad-based rally on Friday with technology, healthcare and financial stocks providing the biggest lift as investors bet on a recovery that is expected to deliver the fastest economic growth since 1984.  The S&P 500 and the Dow ended a seesaw week higher as investors rebalancing their portfolios at the quarter\\'s end continued to buy stocks that stand to benefit from a growing economy while they added some beaten-down technology shares.

(Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation is set to be contained just above the Federal Reserveâs 2% target, and rising market interest rates are a sign of optimism about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.âOur forecast is for inflation to creep up to 2%, and our goal is to have it hit above 2% this year. Our forecast is around 2.1%, but we donât see it running out of control,â Harker said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee.Since January, longer-term interest rates have risen as investors have incorporated positive news on vaccine developments and the prospect for massive fiscal aid, factors which should speed the economic recovery. Thatâs translated into higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, but Harker brushed aside concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on growth.âGood SignââThis is a good sign, in some ways, that rates -- say, the 10-year -- is going up,â Harker said, referring to the 10-year Treasury yield. âPeople are more optimistic about the economy. Weâve been hovering at zero or negative neutral real rates for a while, so the fact that thatâs rising is a good sign because it shows optimism.âThe U.S. central bankâs Federal Open Market Committee, on which Harker sits but does not have a vote on policy decisions this year, published updated quarterly economic projections following its meeting last week. The projections were the first since December -- before the Democratic partyâs victory in January Senate races paved the way for more fiscal relief -- and they showed that Fed officials generally see inflation hovering just above the Fedâs 2% target over the next few years.Thatâs in line with the central bankâs new strategy unveiled last August, in which Fed officials will seek above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation, so that it averages 2% over time.âI am of the camp where we stick with our framework and we let inflation run above 2% for a while -- not out of control past 2%,â Harker said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Asda bosses have lost an equal pay fight with tens of thousands of store workers in a Supreme Court ruling in a \"watershed moment\" for the industry. More than 44,000 current and former workers, about two-thirds of whom are women, brought equal pay claims saying staff working in distribution depots, most of whom are men, are paid more. The Supreme Court backed an earlier Court of Appeal judgment that ruled store workers are entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff for equal pay purposes. The decision, a landmark precedent for the private sector, will send shockwaves through the industry, paving the way for compensation claims against other supermarkets totalling as much as Â£8bn. Equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue, but the ruling demonstrates that private sector firms are not immune and could open the floodgates to more claims. \"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those that have similar staffing models and pay structures,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood.

Earlier this week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced that customers could now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Ark Invest\\'s Cathie Wood isnât so sure investors should use it as a means of payment. What Happened: In a webcast hosted by CBOE, Wood said that those that made profits from Bitcoinâs rally may be the subject of scrutiny by the IRS. The ARK Invest founder explained, \"The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don\\'t think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front.â Why It Matters: From a tax point of view, the IRS currently treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as âproperty,â as they do stocks and bonds. As a result, when investors sell their Bitcoin for fiat currency or use it as a means to purchase another good, they could be subject to massive capital gains taxes. Capital gains on taxes on assets that have been held for less than a year are taxed the same as a personâs âother income,â while assets that are held for longer than this period would be subject to long-term capital gains taxes ranging from 15-20%. While this would make any Tesla purchases with Bitcoin somewhat unfavorable for those that bought the cryptocurrency last year, more recent investors may actually benefit from the current rules. For instance, if an investor purchased the leading cryptocurrency at a higher price than its current value, he or she could actually report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the value of the asset. Price Action: After a volatile week, Bitcoin price recovered from yesterday\\'s low of $50,856 to $53,900 today. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $53,223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Stories Should you Buy a Tesla with BTC?

An unstoppable force is taking over our financial markets. But most Americans wonât see whatâs going on until itâs too late. Hereâs whatâs coming. Nowhere is this clearer than in Nigeria, where the central bank is so worried about Nigerians choosing cryptocurrencies over the naira for overseas remittance payments that it is now paying them to use official channels for those transfers instead.  The central bank announced the scheme after international remittances inflows plummeted last year, as more Nigerians abandoned official banking channels by turning to cheaper cryptocurrency exchanges.  The move came on the heels of a nationwide crackdown on banks dealing in cryptocurrencies, which the government enacted in an attempt to counteract the nairaâs declining value. For more than a year now, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has been ripping higher off of its pandemic lows. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday the stock market rally has been supported by four major pillars over the past year. Unfortunately, two of those pillars may now be cracking, putting the market at risk in the near-term. Essaye listed the following four bullish catalysts as pillars of the stock market rally over the past year. 1. Government stimulus. The U.S. government has already spent about $6 trillion in stimulus to prop up the economy throughout the pandemic downturn. The recent $1.9-trillion stimulus package will likely be the last one, and Essaye said this stock market pillar is now cracked. âBottom line, the outlook for government spending is turning much more mixed, because while there may be more spending (which is good for growth), itâs going to come with tax increases (which is bad for growth), and that mixed outlook is a departure from the past year (where it was all spending and no tax increases),â Essaye said. Related Link: Could Long-Term Capital Gains Selling Be Weighing On The Market? 2. Federal Reserve Accommodation. The Fed dropped its target fed funds interest rate range to between 0% and 0.25% and has been purchasing $120 billion in assets per month to help maintain a healthy credit market. Essaye said this pillar is now also cracked given a growing number of Fed officials said they see a rate hike coming in 2022 as of the Fedâs most recent dot plot projections. 3. Vaccine Optimism. Essaye said vaccine optimism has been a bullish catalyst throughout the rally, from positive critical trial data to FDA approvals to a U.S. vaccine rollout that\\'s now ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Essaye said financial markets have already priced in an end to the pandemic within the next few months, so it\\'s unclear how much stock market upside the vaccine rollout can provide moving forward. 4. No Double-Dip Recession. It seems like a lifetime ago that investors were concerned about a potential double-dip recession in 2020 or 2021. However, employment and earnings have been steadily trending in the right direction, and the chances of a double-dip recession appear extremely low at this point. Benzingaâs Take: The economy is well-positioned to bounce back aggressively in 2021. It remains to be seen if there is more upside to stock prices once support from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve are scaled back.

(NASDAQ: FB). What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is âoff limits right nowâ as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors. Thill said that compared to other companies in the tech sector, Facebook is a âcheap name.â â$15 of earnings power and a mid 20 [P/E] multiple on it, and you are at $350 to $375 on the stock. So you got a lot of upside still on Facebook. We like that,â the analyst added.

Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) is down over 30% since it reached an all-time-high of $159.70 on Feb. 16, but options traders may be seeing more downside for Cathie Woodâs fund, which holds shares of companies that Wood feels are disruptive innovators. The ARKK Trades: At 2:09 p.m. Thursday a trader executed a put sweep of 7,238 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring April 16. The trade represented a $38,000 bearish bet for which the trader paid $5.25 per option contract. At 1:04 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 400 ARKK options with a $110 strike price expiring on Jan. 20, 2023. The trade represented a $1.4-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $26 per option contract. At 11:16 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,500 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring May 21. The trade represented a $2.49-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.60 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 819 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.35-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,028 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.7-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,087 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May 21. The trade represented a $1.78-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.40 per option contract. Together, traders are betting almost $8.76 million that the share price of ARKK is going lower. Why Itâs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating a large move in stock price will occur imminently. A sweeper pays market price for the call options, instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates âsmart moneyâ has entered into a position. About ARKK: Cathie Woodâs Ark ETFs have been wildly popular this year, and retail investors watch the fundâs activity daily to see which companies are being bought and sold. ARKK holds numerous stocks in this fund popular with retail traders such as Telsa Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Although ARKK holds some pharmaceuticals and biosciences companies, most of its holdings are in the tech sector, which is in a rout.

Related Quotes (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England flagged instances of illiquidity as a broader risk to the financial system after a rout in some government bond markets pushed yields higher.The comments in a routine assessment of threats to the financial system indicate concerns at the central bank that Governor Andrew Bailey has sought to play down. The bankâs Financial Policy Committee found that vulnerabilities in the market remain almost a year after they first emerged during a rout at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent appearances, Bailey has said that while officials are watching a surge in bond yields carefully, so far they viewed it as consistent with an improvement in economic outlook. The summary of the FPCâs March 18 meeting agreed with that assessment, but also highlighted risks to liquidity that were exposed by the sell off in debt markets in March 2020.âIn February, the fragile nature of liquidity in some government bond markets had been evident during a period where advanced economy government bond yields had risen markedly,â the BOE report said. âThe FPC judged that recent experience showed the fundamental vulnerabilities in market functioning that had been exposed during the âdash for cashâ remained and could amplify any further repricing.âThe central bank noted recent weak demand from non-dealers at U.S. Treasury auctions after a disastrous sale last month that helped push yields to a higher plane. Bonds have sold off around the globe in recent weeks, pushing U.K. yields to the highest levels since before the pandemic.The European Central Bank confronted the shift with a vow to speed up its own asset purchase program.

Hiring the wrong financial advisor can wreak havoc on your investments and ruin your retirement. However, this new tool is changing everything. (Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation is set to be contained just above the Federal Reserveâs 2% target, and rising market interest rates are a sign of optimism about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.âOur forecast is for inflation to creep up to 2%, and our goal is to have it hit above 2% this year. Our forecast is around 2.1%, but we donât see it running out of control,â Harker said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee.Since January, longer-term interest rates have risen as investors have incorporated positive news on vaccine developments and the prospect for massive fiscal aid, factors which should speed the economic recovery. Thatâs translated into higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, but Harker brushed aside concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on growth.âGood SignââThis is a good sign, in some ways, that rates -- say, the 10-year -- is going up,â Harker said, referring to the 10-year Treasury yield. âPeople are more optimistic about the economy. Weâve been hovering at zero or negative neutral real rates for a while, so the fact that thatâs rising is a good sign because it shows optimism.âThe U.S. central bankâs Federal Open Market Committee, on which Harker sits but does not have a vote on policy decisions this year, published updated quarterly economic projections following its meeting last week. The projections were the first since December -- before the Democratic partyâs victory in January Senate races paved the way for more fiscal relief -- and they showed that Fed officials generally see inflation hovering just above the Fedâs 2% target over the next few years.Thatâs in line with the central bankâs new strategy unveiled last August, in which Fed officials will seek above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation, so that it averages 2% over time.âI am of the camp where we stick with our framework and we let inflation run above 2% for a while -- not out of control past 2%,â Harker said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Asda bosses have lost an equal pay fight with tens of thousands of store workers in a Supreme Court ruling in a \"watershed moment\" for the industry. More than 44,000 current and former workers, about two-thirds of whom are women, brought equal pay claims saying staff working in distribution depots, most of whom are men, are paid more. The Supreme Court backed an earlier Court of Appeal judgment that ruled store workers are entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff for equal pay purposes. The decision, a landmark precedent for the private sector, will send shockwaves through the industry, paving the way for compensation claims against other supermarkets totalling as much as Â£8bn. Equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue, but the ruling demonstrates that private sector firms are not immune and could open the floodgates to more claims. \"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those that have similar staffing models and pay structures,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood.

Earlier this week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced that customers could now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Ark Invest\\'s Cathie Wood isnât so sure investors should use it as a means of payment. What Happened: In a webcast hosted by CBOE, Wood said that those that made profits from Bitcoinâs rally may be the subject of scrutiny by the IRS. The ARK Invest founder explained, \"The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don\\'t think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front.â Why It Matters: From a tax point of view, the IRS currently treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as âproperty,â as they do stocks and bonds. As a result, when investors sell their Bitcoin for fiat currency or use it as a means to purchase another good, they could be subject to massive capital gains taxes. Capital gains on taxes on assets that have been held for less than a year are taxed the same as a personâs âother income,â while assets that are held for longer than this period would be subject to long-term capital gains taxes ranging from 15-20%. While this would make any Tesla purchases with Bitcoin somewhat unfavorable for those that bought the cryptocurrency last year, more recent investors may actually benefit from the current rules. For instance, if an investor purchased the leading cryptocurrency at a higher price than its current value, he or she could actually report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the value of the asset. Price Action: After a volatile week, Bitcoin price recovered from yesterday\\'s low of $50,856 to $53,900 today. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $53,223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Stories Should you Buy a Tesla with BTC?

An unstoppable force is taking over our financial markets. But most Americans wonât see whatâs going on until itâs too late. Hereâs whatâs coming. Nowhere is this clearer than in Nigeria, where the central bank is so worried about Nigerians choosing cryptocurrencies over the naira for overseas remittance payments that it is now paying them to use official channels for those transfers instead.  The central bank announced the scheme after international remittances inflows plummeted last year, as more Nigerians abandoned official banking channels by turning to cheaper cryptocurrency exchanges.  The move came on the heels of a nationwide crackdown on banks dealing in cryptocurrencies, which the government enacted in an attempt to counteract the nairaâs declining value. For more than a year now, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has been ripping higher off of its pandemic lows. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday the stock market rally has been supported by four major pillars over the past year. Unfortunately, two of those pillars may now be cracking, putting the market at risk in the near-term. Essaye listed the following four bullish catalysts as pillars of the stock market rally over the past year. 1. Government stimulus. The U.S. government has already spent about $6 trillion in stimulus to prop up the economy throughout the pandemic downturn. The recent $1.9-trillion stimulus package will likely be the last one, and Essaye said this stock market pillar is now cracked. âBottom line, the outlook for government spending is turning much more mixed, because while there may be more spending (which is good for growth), itâs going to come with tax increases (which is bad for growth), and that mixed outlook is a departure from the past year (where it was all spending and no tax increases),â Essaye said. Related Link: Could Long-Term Capital Gains Selling Be Weighing On The Market? 2. Federal Reserve Accommodation. The Fed dropped its target fed funds interest rate range to between 0% and 0.25% and has been purchasing $120 billion in assets per month to help maintain a healthy credit market. Essaye said this pillar is now also cracked given a growing number of Fed officials said they see a rate hike coming in 2022 as of the Fedâs most recent dot plot projections. 3. Vaccine Optimism. Essaye said vaccine optimism has been a bullish catalyst throughout the rally, from positive critical trial data to FDA approvals to a U.S. vaccine rollout that\\'s now ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Essaye said financial markets have already priced in an end to the pandemic within the next few months, so it\\'s unclear how much stock market upside the vaccine rollout can provide moving forward. 4. No Double-Dip Recession. It seems like a lifetime ago that investors were concerned about a potential double-dip recession in 2020 or 2021. However, employment and earnings have been steadily trending in the right direction, and the chances of a double-dip recession appear extremely low at this point. Benzingaâs Take: The economy is well-positioned to bounce back aggressively in 2021. It remains to be seen if there is more upside to stock prices once support from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve are scaled back.

(NASDAQ: FB). What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is âoff limits right nowâ as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors. Thill said that compared to other companies in the tech sector, Facebook is a âcheap name.â â$15 of earnings power and a mid 20 [P/E] multiple on it, and you are at $350 to $375 on the stock. So you got a lot of upside still on Facebook. We like that,â the analyst added.

Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) is down over 30% since it reached an all-time-high of $159.70 on Feb. 16, but options traders may be seeing more downside for Cathie Woodâs fund, which holds shares of companies that Wood feels are disruptive innovators. The ARKK Trades: At 2:09 p.m. Thursday a trader executed a put sweep of 7,238 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring April 16. The trade represented a $38,000 bearish bet for which the trader paid $5.25 per option contract. At 1:04 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 400 ARKK options with a $110 strike price expiring on Jan. 20, 2023. The trade represented a $1.4-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $26 per option contract. At 11:16 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,500 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring May 21. The trade represented a $2.49-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.60 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 819 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.35-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,028 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.7-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,087 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May 21. The trade represented a $1.78-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.40 per option contract. Together, traders are betting almost $8.76 million that the share price of ARKK is going lower. Why Itâs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating a large move in stock price will occur imminently. A sweeper pays market price for the call options, instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates âsmart moneyâ has entered into a position. About ARKK: Cathie Woodâs Ark ETFs have been wildly popular this year, and retail investors watch the fundâs activity daily to see which companies are being bought and sold. ARKK holds numerous stocks in this fund popular with retail traders such as Telsa Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Although ARKK holds some pharmaceuticals and biosciences companies, most of its holdings are in the tech sector, which is in a rout.

       "  '\\n\\t\\t\\tCopyright Â© 2021 InvestorPlace Media, LLC. All rights reserved. 1125 N. Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201.\\t\\t So far, 2021 has not been kind to FAANG stocks, with the exception of Alphabetâs (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Theyâve been caught up in a broad sell-off of tech stocks that lasted through February and three of the five have lost ground. At this point, the other tech stocks in that group have lost an average of 3% on the year. GOOG stock, on the other hand, has performed very well. Itâs up nearly 18% in 2021. Last year, Google stock delivered a return of 30% for the year â the lowest among the FAANG stocks. This year, GOOG stock growth is setting a much higher pace and leaving the other FAANGs behind. Whatâs going on with Google stock? And just as importantly, is it going to continue? Google isnât the perfect growth stock. There are potential speed bumps ahead and it rates a âBâ in Portfolio Grader. However, at this point itâs looking like the horse to bet on in 2021 if youâre looking to add a FAANG stock to your portfolio. Early in 2020, there was concern that the pandemic was going to crater advertising spending. Googleâs ad revenue was under threat. We saw that scenario play out when the company reported ad revenue dropped 8% in the second quarter. That marked its first decline in 26 years. However, as the year went on, the situation improved significantly. In Q3, ad revenue of $37.1 billion was up nearly 10% year-over-year. In Q4, parent company Alphabet announced $56.9 billion in total revenue, up 23% YoY. As America comes out of the pandemic, spending on advertising is expected to expand. Google has also been aggressively repurchasing stock, helping to fuel GOOG stock growth. In Q4, the company bought $7.9 billion of its own shares, after repurchasing the same amount in Q3, and $16.9 billion in Q2. The company still has more than $15 billion committed to share buybacks. The companyâs cloud computing division has been unprofitable, but it is growing and Google says the margins are improving. After years of the company investing in infrastructure, analysts are looking to Google Cloud to begin adding to the companyâs profitability. Without a doubt, the biggest threat to Google remains government investigation and regulation.\\xa0 With the worldâs most popular mobile operating system (Android) and the worldâs most popular search engine (Google Search), the company has been in regulator sights worldwide. In recent years, EU courts have found the company guilty in three antitrust cases, fining Google a total of $9.7 billion. The company is currently fighting with the government of Australia over payment for linking to stories on news sites. Google has already agreed to pay news publications in France for links.\\xa0 In the U.S., the company is facing lawsuits from the Justice Department and multiple state attorneys general. It is defending itself against charges that it is a monopoly that uses anticompetitive tactics to throttle competition and control online advertising. Google is not immune to challenges. In particular, these challenges are the threat of government regulation globally, and anti-monopoly lawsuits filed by U.S. agencies. However, it could take several years for most of the current lawsuits to wind their way through the courts. And analysts are betting the worst-case result is more fines. The $9.7 billion Google ended up paying the EU in antitrust fines was a record amount, but it hardly hurt the company. Google is also working to appease regulators with a move to improve privacy by phasing out third-party cookies. The company is sitting on more than $120 billion in cash reserves, so it should be able to easily absorb another hefty penalty if it comes to that. Investment analysts have little hesitation in recommending GOOG stock. Those tracked by the Wall Street Journal have Google rated as a consensus âbuy.â Of the 44 analysts, 36 rate GOOG as a âbuy,â five have it as âoverweightâ and three holdouts have it as a âhold.â Thatâs a pretty decisive recommendation. Their average 12-month price target of $2,382.17 offers 17% upside. If youâre interested in adding a FAANG stock to your portfolio, Google is making a strong case for itself in 2021.

       "  'Things got personal Thursday during a virtual Congressional hearing to elicit testimony about misinformation online from three of the world\\'s most powerful CEOs, with lawmakers demanding to know what concerns Facebookâs CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabetâs CEO Sundar Pichai, had about social mediaâs impact on their own children. The issue of protecting childrenâs welfare, and particularly mental health, emerged as a major theme at the hearing before the House Energy & Commerce Committee, which also featured Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, following recent reports that Facebookâs (FB) Instagram is developing a sister photo-sharing platform for children under the age of 13. Facebook and Googleâs (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube have already rolled out sister products tailored to children. âWhat do you say when one of your children doesnât want to put their phone down?â Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA) asked Pichai, after accusing Google and Facebook of doing a âpoor jobâ of keeping children under 13 off their platforms, and actively onboarding children onto their ecosystems using YouTube Kids, and Facebookâs Messenger Kids. âThe struggle is the same, and particularly through COVID it\\'s been â it\\'s been hard to moderate it,â Pichai said after earlier saying that he worries about the amount of time his kids spend online. âAnd I do take advantage of the parental controls and the digital well being tools so we can limit the time on their apps, and so we have provisions in place.â Zuckerberg told the committee that his children â ages 3 and 5 â donât use social media, and that his company was designing tools that would put parents in control. âI think we\\'ve proven that that can be a good and safe experience, and I think that was one of the things that made us think that we should consider doing this for Instagram,â Zuckerberg said, explaining that Facebook was still thinking through how the service would work. Twitterâs CEO also didnât get a free pass from accounting how his platform is protecting children. Committee members repeatedly pushed the CEOs to answer accusations that their platforms are used to share exploitative images and videos of children. They were also questioned over the impact on the mental health of children who spend excessive time on their services, and why, in Facebookâs case, itâs creating a version of Instagram for children under the age of 13. âYouâre plotting your next frontier of growth,â Bill Johnson (R-OH) said. âBig Tech is essentially handing our children a lit cigarette and hoping they stay addicted for life,â Johnson added, comparing social mediaâs addictive qualities to Big Tobacco. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) hypothesized that an increase in teen suicide in her district could be directly linked to teenâs social media use, and pushed the trio of CEOs to answer if their companies had researched the impact of social media on younger users. âToo much time on screens and social media is leading to loneliness and despair, and it seems to be an accepted truth in the tech industry. Because what weâre hearing today is that making money is more important,â Rodgers said. Zuckerberg pushed back to the lines questioning saying that users who spend time online connecting with people are, in fact, less lonely. The CEO of Google also faced a tough line of questioning over YouTube, which it owns, with Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) expressing concerns over YouTubeâs advertisments targeting children. In 2019, Google and YouTube paid a record fine of $170 million to settle claims by the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General that it collected childrenâs personal information without their parents\\' consent. Pichai said YouTube had removed close to 1 million videos based on concerns over child safety, and complies with regulations. âThere are scenarios in which there could be family viewing, and today there are creators who create content oriented towards families, and as part of that there are advertisers which are interested in connecting with those users,â Pichai said. Committee members also raised the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, as well as a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado and a recent shooting spree in Atlanta as evidence that social networks still arenât doing enough to limit the spread of violent, extremist content. For their parts, Zuckerberg, Dorsey, and Pichai said they are continuing to work to tamp down such content and limit its spread across their networks. Missing from the hearing were expected substantive debates over solutions for how to fix Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law passed in 1996. The law, which provides liability protection for websites and platforms that host user-generated content and allows sites to moderate that content, has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. Many Democrats say it allows social media sites to host extremist content on their platforms without fear of repercussions, while Republicans contend it censors conservative voices. Zuckerberg, Pichai, and Dorsey each offered their own takes on how to address the law, with Zuckerberg saying it should be tweaked for larger companies, Pichai calling for greater transparency into moderation, and Dorsey proposing an open-source social networking protocol. Committee members, however, didnât offer much in the way of their own proposals. Representatives also continued to fail to come to an agreement on what exactly it is that they so vehemently disagree with when it comes to Section 230. And while they raised important issues about the impact of social media on children, until lawmakers can explain their problem with the law, it will go unchanged.

Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyItâs hardly a shock when mega-famous YouTubers face public scrutiny these days. From Jeffree Star to James Charles to Nikita Dragun to Jake and Logan Paul, the platformâs biggest stars routinely appear in and out of the news cycle for tasteless videos, old, offensive tweets and their own beefs with other YouTubers. The amount of mess these influencers supply on a monthly basis even requires its own subcommunity of drama and tea channels to keep track of it all.For David Dobrik though, whoâs mostly side-stepped major scandals and the high-school shenanigans of the platform (aside from the ones in his own videos) and built his reputation online as an approachable, nice guyâGen Zâs Jimmy Fallon, as The Wall Street Journal called him earlier this monthâhis fall from grace represents the risks of a specific type of white masculinity thatâs often enabled and goes unchecked until itâs too late.Jake Paul Believes COVID Is âa Hoaxâ and â98% of News Is FakeâFirst, a summary. Dobrik, 24, is a former Viner who moved to YouTube after the app shut down, along with Logan Paul and Nash Greir. Over the past five years, heâs built his own famous posse of fellow YouTubers, actors and comedians known as The Vlog Squad who are featured in his videos. What happens when they get together can best be described as a hybrid of Friends and Jackass. Dorbrik and his semi-famous coterie pull pranks, perform stunts, ride around Los Angeles in his car, hang out with celebrities, and give away money. The antics in these vlogs represent a type of recklessness and brashness that only a group of white people can get away with or find entertaining at the expense of other people. (Several videos include real-life altercations and pranks with law enforcement). Dobrik maintains that the goal of these videos is âto make people happy,â which, along with his baby face and boy-next-door aura, has shielded him from accusations that heâs promoting fraternity culture. Until the events of last week, that is.On March 23, Dobrik posted an apology video, his second over the course of a week, regarding allegations from an anonymous woman who claims that a former member of The Vlog Squad named Dominykas Zeglaitis engaged in sexual activity with her when she was too intoxicated to consent.In a report for The Insider published last Tuesday, the woman under the pseudonym âHannahâ says that, in November 2018, she and a group of friends were invited by Zeglaitis, also known as Durte Dom, to meet him and Dobrik at an apartment where she was illegally given alcohol. Dobrik filmed the events of the night including âHannahâ entering Zeglatitisâs bedroom where she engaged in drunk group sex. Dobrik posted an edited version of the encounter to YouTube in a video titled âSHE SHOULDNâT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!â He eventually deleted the video at the womanâs request, but it had already been seen 5 million times.Since the article was published, several brands including Dollar Shave Club, DoorDash, Chipotle, EA Sports, Frankâs RedHot, SeatGeek and Honey have cut ties with Dobrik. And on Monday, Dubrik announced that he was stepping down from the board of Dispo, a disposable camera app he founded, âto not distract from the companyâs growthâ after the venture capital firm Spark Capital announced they were parting ways. The Insider also reported that the YouTuber had lost more than 66 million views since Friday, some presumably due to the deletion of at least five old videos.After receiving criticism for the brief video he posted last week in which he mostly distanced himself from Zeglaitis and emphasized how much he values consent as a creator, Dobrik leaves little room for fluff or misinterpretation in his second attempt.âI want to start this video off by saying I fully believe the woman who came out against Dom,â said Dobrik in his latest apology.The result, an 7-minute video that includes a trigger warning across the screen and even bleeps out the words ârapeâ and âsexual assualt,â is actually quite impressive in the amount of correction and precision it entails. Thereâs a noticeably concerted effort to out-somber the original apology; a minimal background in front of a couch, a closer zoom on his face, tears, an announcement of a hiatus. He pointedly notifies viewers that heâs filming at 1:45 in the morning, indicating that the matter is more important than his sleep. He goes on to say that he doesnât want âto use buzzwords to justify or explainâ the incident but employs a very specific and familiar vocabulary of words and phrases that have been made more accessible to the publicâand unfortunately men who need to keep their jobsâin light of the #MeToo movement.For instance, he acknowledges the âunfair power dynamicâ that exists between him, a highly influential, male celebrity, and impressionable fans that he wasnât aware of before but apparently understands now after having conversations with different people over the past week. He highlights the lack of infrastructure in his content creation that he wants to change when he returns from a break, invoking a discussion about workplace safety thatâs been bolstered in regards to #MeToo and other sectors of the entertainment industry and contract work. He also apologizes for not believing women like YouTubers Trisha Paytas and Ally Hardesty who spoke out against male members of the Vlog Squad in the past, including Zeglaitis, for their alleged misconduct. Maybe the moment most telling of Dobrikâs (or his publicistâs) awareness of what it means to take accountability in the digital age when he astutely negates the idea that heâs being âcancelledâ and frames the consequences heâs facing as ultimately positive and deserved.Itâs interesting that these consequences come now when just a month ago a former Vlog Squad member Seth Francois spoke with Buzzfeed News about his negative experiences filming with Dobrik. One can assume the immediate reactions from brands working with Dobrik was more of a bandwagon effect than each of the companies reaching a decision completely on their own based on the allegations. Still, itâs upsetting that Francoisâ revelations about filming with the Vlog Squad, including a prank that was pulled on him that he now considers sexual assault, didnât make anyone budge.In a since-deleted video from 2017 titled âHE THOUGHT HE WAS KISSING HER!! (SUPER CRINGEY),â Dobrik tricks Francois into kissing another Vlog Squad member, 47-year-old comedian Jason Nash, by telling him he would be kissing model Corinna Kopf, also a Vlog Squad member, wearing a disguise. The article also mentions the accusations of racism Francois initially made against Dobrik and co. last June in a video titled âaccountability to all creators.â In it, he includes clips from now-deleted videos in which Dobrik jokes about taking him to a police station and another where Francois is told to open a refrigerator thatâs been packed with watermelon. Dobrik vaguely expressed remorse for his past indiscretions on his podcast after Francois published the video, which prompted complaints that his apology wasnât sufficient. But he didnât suffer any material consequences or feel the need to post a better apology, instead removing old, problematic videos from his channel.Comparing how seriously society treats allegations of sexual assault as opposed to allegations of racism or allegations of sexual assault by men is a tricky discussion to have publicly and mostly benefits oppressors by ranking acts of harm. But the controversies surrounding Dobrik as well as the most recent allegations against Joss Whedon, following Ray Fisherâs allegations against him last year, demonstrate the value in believing people of color, as the mistreatment of one marginalized group often foretells or illuminates the mistreatment of another.So whatâs next for Dobrik? One can only assume that after a few months of silence, Dobrik will return to his 18.6 million subscribers and continue to profit off of his content with just a few less millions in his pocket. Although, itâs hard to imagine the internet juggernaut failing to secure more deals in the future. The infrastructure Dobrik claims he wants to implement going forward will mostly serve as a smokescreen, as anyone whoâs observed YouTube culture over the past decade understands that checks and balances donât exist on this realm on the web. His biggest challenge presumably will be maintaining his signature shock value while respecting human beings and their boundaries, something much of his content seems to lack.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty ImagesSince the Atlanta spa shootings, the U.S. media has been working harder than usual to describe and understand Asian Americans. Asian Americans represent a population of 21 million people, with astounding ethnic and socioeconomic diversity. Yet the same two stereotypes often emerge in news coverage about them. One is that of Asian Americans as the âperpetual foreignerâ â immigrants who constantly struggle, never assimilate. Thatâs how the six Chinese and Korean American women killed in the Atlanta area on March 16 came off in early stories about the massacre. The news media persisted in referring to victims as âwomen of Asian descentâ â versus âAsian American womenâ â even after it became clear several were not recent immigrants. These victims, six of the eight dead, donât fit into the other Asian American stereotype of the upwardly mobile, educated and eager-to-fit-in immigrant â the âmodel minority.â As a journalism researcher who has published studies on the news mediaâs tendency to render some groups in the U.S. as more American than others, I know both the âmodel minorityâ and âperpetual foreignerâ myths well. Both stereotypes have been levied in tandem against Asian immigrants to the U.S. for centuries. Model minority In the mid-1800s, Chinese laborers made up the first significant wave of Asian immigration to the United States. Recruited during the Gold Rush and to build the Transcontinental Railroad, the men were described by employers like industrialist Leland Stanford as âquiet, peaceable, patient, industrious and economical.â In California, Chinese immigrants were employed by the railroads to do the toughest work. George Rinhart/Corbis via Getty Images As that initial population of 4,000 Chinese Americans in 1850 burgeoned, though, they were accused of taking white menâs jobs. Hostility and violence also grew against them. From the subsequent Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers, to the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II, Asian Americans were still seen as hardworking and submissive â yet also dangerous and alien. The model-minority myth emerged later. In 1965 the Hart-Celler Act opened immigration quotas that had previously favored Western Europeans. That spurred a major wave of immigration from across the globe, including Asia, to the United States. Bolstered by university offers of international graduate scholarships, this policy favored highly skilled immigrants from Taiwan, South Korea, India, Japan and beyond. My father, Tien-Yuh Chuang, who boarded a trans-Pacific flight from Taipei to San Francisco in 1965 with US$300, a suitcase and his letter of admission to an engineering doctoral program at University of California, Berkeley, was among them. Many of the Hart-Celler immigrants were funneled into growing numbers of professional jobs in science and technology fields. They were part of the United Statesâs push to become a world leader in everything from the space race to transportation. Out-earning all other racial groups, Asian Americans became the âmodel minority,â a term first coined by sociologist William Petersen in a 1966 New York Times article, âSuccess Story: Japanese American style.â A family in Los Angeles celebrates college graduation. Joe Sohm/Visions of America/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Perpetual foreigner As U.S. immigration policy shifted to favor family reunification and diversity of origin, waves of Asians came to the U.S. from the mid-1970s to 1980s and onward. Some were refugees resettled from places where the U.S. had gotten involved in wars, like Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and South Korea. Other immigrants came from China, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, the Philippines and more, attempting to lift their families out of poverty. Without the same educational and professional sponsorships as my father had, many in these later waves founded mom-and-pop businesses and peer lending networks. They gravitated toward blue-collar industries and âpink-collarâ jobs in salons, food service or child care. Often serving affluent Americans who looked the other way at their struggle, or their very existence, members of this Asian America are perpetually foreign, and doubly invisible. A mom-and-pop grocery store in Chinatown, New York City. Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images The women who worked and died at Youngâs Asian Massage, Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa lived in this Asian America â not my fatherâs or mine. Between the ages of 33 and 74, more than half were over 50. They worked in a low-wage industry in which Asian immigrant ownership is linked to assumptions about sex work. This fits into the exotic Asian prostitute stereotype, as old as Suzie Wong or Miss Saigon. However, immigrant-run massage and spa establishments perform legitimate business transactions every day. They massage feet and backs, do acupuncture, give facials. Itâs also possible for both legal massage and sex work to occur at the same business, not involving every worker or every client. [Youâre smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversationâs authors and editors. You can read us daily by subscribing to our newsletter.] Such workers make up the other side of the high-earning âmodel minorityâ statistic. That data masks the fact that Asian Americans have the highest income inequality of any racial group, with the top 10% of this population earning more than 10 times what the bottom 10% earns. Dangerous stereotypes This second Asian America is less likely to work from home or have access to power. That, combined with perceptions that they are not fully American, may make them more vulnerable to attacks like the 3,800 documented hate incidents against Asian Americans since the pandemic started. A memorial at Gold Spa, in Atlanta, after the March 16 shootings. Megan Varner/Getty Images When Asian Americans are so easily, and so often, stereotyped, they become categories, not people â not individuals who make lives, raise families and do the best they can in their adopted homeland. In the case of the Atlanta killings, many early media portrayals obscured the victimsâ dignity or distinctness as mothers and grandmothers, a business owner, a former school teacher, an avid line dancer and a lover of Korean soap operas who cooked a mean kimchi jjigae â in short, as Americans. âMy mother didnât do anything wrong,â the son of 63-year-old Yong Ae Yue, the fan of Korean soap operas and cooking, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. âAnd she deserves the recognition that she is a human.âThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England flagged instances of illiquidity as a broader risk to the financial system after a rout in some government bond markets pushed yields higher.The comments in a routine assessment of threats to the financial system indicate concerns at the central bank that Governor Andrew Bailey has sought to play down. The bankâs Financial Policy Committee found that vulnerabilities in the market remain almost a year after they first emerged during a rout at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent appearances, Bailey has said that while officials are watching a surge in bond yields carefully, so far they viewed it as consistent with an improvement in economic outlook. The summary of the FPCâs March 18 meeting agreed with that assessment, but also highlighted risks to liquidity that were exposed by the sell off in debt markets in March 2020.âIn February, the fragile nature of liquidity in some government bond markets had been evident during a period where advanced economy government bond yields had risen markedly,â the BOE report said. âThe FPC judged that recent experience showed the fundamental vulnerabilities in market functioning that had been exposed during the âdash for cashâ remained and could amplify any further repricing.âThe central bank noted recent weak demand from non-dealers at U.S. Treasury auctions after a disastrous sale last month that helped push yields to a higher plane. Bonds have sold off around the globe in recent weeks, pushing U.K. yields to the highest levels since before the pandemic.The European Central Bank confronted the shift with a vow to speed up its own asset purchase program. BOE officials gave tacit approval to the increase in yields, declining to intervene in the market in their last decision on monetary policy on March 18.BOE policy makers also discussed:How online shopping and working from home will change the structure of the economy.The panel saw risks from weaker earnings prospects and insolvencies that are likely to rise from their current very low levelsThe FPC released details of previous discussions about the implications of a disorderly Brexit for open-ended commercial real estate funds.

(Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation is set to be contained just above the Federal Reserveâs 2% target, and rising market interest rates are a sign of optimism about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.âOur forecast is for inflation to creep up to 2%, and our goal is to have it hit above 2% this year. Our forecast is around 2.1%, but we donât see it running out of control,â Harker said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee.Since January, longer-term interest rates have risen as investors have incorporated positive news on vaccine developments and the prospect for massive fiscal aid, factors which should speed the economic recovery. Thatâs translated into higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, but Harker brushed aside concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on growth.âGood SignââThis is a good sign, in some ways, that rates -- say, the 10-year -- is going up,â Harker said, referring to the 10-year Treasury yield. âPeople are more optimistic about the economy. Weâve been hovering at zero or negative neutral real rates for a while, so the fact that thatâs rising is a good sign because it shows optimism.âThe U.S. central bankâs Federal Open Market Committee, on which Harker sits but does not have a vote on policy decisions this year, published updated quarterly economic projections following its meeting last week. The projections were the first since December -- before the Democratic partyâs victory in January Senate races paved the way for more fiscal relief -- and they showed that Fed officials generally see inflation hovering just above the Fedâs 2% target over the next few years.Thatâs in line with the central bankâs new strategy unveiled last August, in which Fed officials will seek above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation, so that it averages 2% over time.âI am of the camp where we stick with our framework and we let inflation run above 2% for a while -- not out of control past 2%,â Harker said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Asda bosses have lost an equal pay fight with tens of thousands of store workers in a Supreme Court ruling in a \"watershed moment\" for the industry. More than 44,000 current and former workers, about two-thirds of whom are women, brought equal pay claims saying staff working in distribution depots, most of whom are men, are paid more. The Supreme Court backed an earlier Court of Appeal judgment that ruled store workers are entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff for equal pay purposes. The decision, a landmark precedent for the private sector, will send shockwaves through the industry, paving the way for compensation claims against other supermarkets totalling as much as Â£8bn. Equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue, but the ruling demonstrates that private sector firms are not immune and could open the floodgates to more claims. \"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those that have similar staffing models and pay structures,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood.

Earlier this week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced that customers could now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Ark Invest\\'s Cathie Wood isnât so sure investors should use it as a means of payment. What Happened: In a webcast hosted by CBOE, Wood said that those that made profits from Bitcoinâs rally may be the subject of scrutiny by the IRS. The ARK Invest founder explained, \"The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don\\'t think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front.â Why It Matters: From a tax point of view, the IRS currently treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as âproperty,â as they do stocks and bonds. As a result, when investors sell their Bitcoin for fiat currency or use it as a means to purchase another good, they could be subject to massive capital gains taxes. Capital gains on taxes on assets that have been held for less than a year are taxed the same as a personâs âother income,â while assets that are held for longer than this period would be subject to long-term capital gains taxes ranging from 15-20%. While this would make any Tesla purchases with Bitcoin somewhat unfavorable for those that bought the cryptocurrency last year, more recent investors may actually benefit from the current rules. For instance, if an investor purchased the leading cryptocurrency at a higher price than its current value, he or she could actually report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the value of the asset. Price Action: After a volatile week, Bitcoin price recovered from yesterday\\'s low of $50,856 to $53,900 today. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $53,223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Stories Should you Buy a Tesla with BTC?

Joel Litmanâs L.O.C.K. system predicted the March 2020 crashâ¦Now it says all Americans should do one thing before April. Nowhere is this clearer than in Nigeria, where the central bank is so worried about Nigerians choosing cryptocurrencies over the naira for overseas remittance payments that it is now paying them to use official channels for those transfers instead.  The central bank announced the scheme after international remittances inflows plummeted last year, as more Nigerians abandoned official banking channels by turning to cheaper cryptocurrency exchanges.  The move came on the heels of a nationwide crackdown on banks dealing in cryptocurrencies, which the government enacted in an attempt to counteract the nairaâs declining value. For more than a year now, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has been ripping higher off of its pandemic lows. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday the stock market rally has been supported by four major pillars over the past year. Unfortunately, two of those pillars may now be cracking, putting the market at risk in the near-term. Essaye listed the following four bullish catalysts as pillars of the stock market rally over the past year. 1. Government stimulus. The U.S. government has already spent about $6 trillion in stimulus to prop up the economy throughout the pandemic downturn. The recent $1.9-trillion stimulus package will likely be the last one, and Essaye said this stock market pillar is now cracked. âBottom line, the outlook for government spending is turning much more mixed, because while there may be more spending (which is good for growth), itâs going to come with tax increases (which is bad for growth), and that mixed outlook is a departure from the past year (where it was all spending and no tax increases),â Essaye said. Related Link: Could Long-Term Capital Gains Selling Be Weighing On The Market? 2. Federal Reserve Accommodation. The Fed dropped its target fed funds interest rate range to between 0% and 0.25% and has been purchasing $120 billion in assets per month to help maintain a healthy credit market. Essaye said this pillar is now also cracked given a growing number of Fed officials said they see a rate hike coming in 2022 as of the Fedâs most recent dot plot projections. 3. Vaccine Optimism. Essaye said vaccine optimism has been a bullish catalyst throughout the rally, from positive critical trial data to FDA approvals to a U.S. vaccine rollout that\\'s now ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Essaye said financial markets have already priced in an end to the pandemic within the next few months, so it\\'s unclear how much stock market upside the vaccine rollout can provide moving forward. 4. No Double-Dip Recession. It seems like a lifetime ago that investors were concerned about a potential double-dip recession in 2020 or 2021. However, employment and earnings have been steadily trending in the right direction, and the chances of a double-dip recession appear extremely low at this point. Benzingaâs Take: The economy is well-positioned to bounce back aggressively in 2021. It remains to be seen if there is more upside to stock prices once support from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve are scaled back.

Once we see certain \\'elements\\' we look for in these types of companies, history has shown us unprecedented gains, and they usually come quick. âAlthough we both care greatly for each other, our relationship started as and remains a mutually beneficial one: money for me, companionship for him.â Veteran wall street tech analyst Brent Thill has cautioned against buying stocks in the underperforming tech sector, with the exception of social media giant Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB). What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is âoff limits right nowâ as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors. Thill said that compared to other companies in the tech sector, Facebook is a âcheap name.â â$15 of earnings power and a mid 20 [P/E] multiple on it, and you are at $350 to $375 on the stock. So you got a lot of upside still on Facebook. We like that,â the analyst added.

Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) is down over 30% since it reached an all-time-high of $159.70 on Feb. 16, but options traders may be seeing more downside for Cathie Woodâs fund, which holds shares of companies that Wood feels are disruptive innovators. The ARKK Trades: At 2:09 p.m. Thursday a trader executed a put sweep of 7,238 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring April 16. The trade represented a $38,000 bearish bet for which the trader paid $5.25 per option contract. At 1:04 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 400 ARKK options with a $110 strike price expiring on Jan. 20, 2023. The trade represented a $1.4-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $26 per option contract. At 11:16 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,500 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring May 21. The trade represented a $2.49-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.60 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 819 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.35-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,028 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.7-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,087 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May 21. The trade represented a $1.78-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.40 per option contract. Together, traders are betting almost $8.76 million that the share price of ARKK is going lower. Why Itâs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating a large move in stock price will occur imminently. A sweeper pays market price for the call options, instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates âsmart moneyâ has entered into a position. About ARKK: Cathie Woodâs Ark ETFs have been wildly popular this year, and retail investors watch the fundâs activity daily to see which companies are being bought and sold. ARKK holds numerous stocks in this fund popular with retail traders such as Telsa Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Although ARKK holds some pharmaceuticals and biosciences companies, most of its holdings are in the tech sector, which is in a rout.

       "  'Let\\'s talk about the popular Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG.L). The company\\'s shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the companyâs outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Alphabetâs outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.  View our latest analysis for Alphabet  Good news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $2989.46, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Whatâs more interesting is that, Alphabetâs share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta. Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so letâs also take a look at the company\\'s future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 55% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? Since GOOG.L is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation. Are you a potential investor? If youâve been keeping an eye on GOOG.L for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isnât fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means itâs not too late to buy GOOG.L. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.

Related Quotes (Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England flagged instances of illiquidity as a broader risk to the financial system after a rout in some government bond markets pushed yields higher.The comments in a routine assessment of threats to the financial system indicate concerns at the central bank that Governor Andrew Bailey has sought to play down. The bankâs Financial Policy Committee found that vulnerabilities in the market remain almost a year after they first emerged during a rout at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent appearances, Bailey has said that while officials are watching a surge in bond yields carefully, so far they viewed it as consistent with an improvement in economic outlook. The summary of the FPCâs March 18 meeting agreed with that assessment, but also highlighted risks to liquidity that were exposed by the sell off in debt markets in March 2020.âIn February, the fragile nature of liquidity in some government bond markets had been evident during a period where advanced economy government bond yields had risen markedly,â the BOE report said. âThe FPC judged that recent experience showed the fundamental vulnerabilities in market functioning that had been exposed during the âdash for cashâ remained and could amplify any further repricing.âThe central bank noted recent weak demand from non-dealers at U.S. Treasury auctions after a disastrous sale last month that helped push yields to a higher plane. Bonds have sold off around the globe in recent weeks, pushing U.K. yields to the highest levels since before the pandemic.The European Central Bank confronted the shift with a vow to speed up its own asset purchase program. BOE officials gave tacit approval to the increase in yields, declining to intervene in the market in their last decision on monetary policy on March 18.BOE policy makers also discussed:How online shopping and working from home will change the structure of the economy.The panel saw risks from weaker earnings prospects and insolvencies that are likely to rise from their current very low levelsThe FPC released details of previous discussions about the implications of a disorderly Brexit for open-ended commercial real estate funds.

The S&P 500 and Dow rose in a broad-based rally on Friday with technology, healthcare and financial stocks providing the biggest lift as investors bet on a recovery that is expected to deliver the fastest economic growth since 1984.  The S&P 500 and the Dow ended a seesaw week higher as investors rebalancing their portfolios at the quarter\\'s end continued to buy stocks that stand to benefit from a growing economy while they added some beaten-down technology shares.

Hiring the wrong financial advisor can wreak havoc on your investments and ruin your retirement. However, this new tool is changing everything. (Bloomberg) -- U.S. inflation is set to be contained just above the Federal Reserveâs 2% target, and rising market interest rates are a sign of optimism about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said.âOur forecast is for inflation to creep up to 2%, and our goal is to have it hit above 2% this year. Our forecast is around 2.1%, but we donât see it running out of control,â Harker said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee.Since January, longer-term interest rates have risen as investors have incorporated positive news on vaccine developments and the prospect for massive fiscal aid, factors which should speed the economic recovery. Thatâs translated into higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, but Harker brushed aside concerns about the effect of higher interest rates on growth.âGood SignââThis is a good sign, in some ways, that rates -- say, the 10-year -- is going up,â Harker said, referring to the 10-year Treasury yield. âPeople are more optimistic about the economy. Weâve been hovering at zero or negative neutral real rates for a while, so the fact that thatâs rising is a good sign because it shows optimism.âThe U.S. central bankâs Federal Open Market Committee, on which Harker sits but does not have a vote on policy decisions this year, published updated quarterly economic projections following its meeting last week. The projections were the first since December -- before the Democratic partyâs victory in January Senate races paved the way for more fiscal relief -- and they showed that Fed officials generally see inflation hovering just above the Fedâs 2% target over the next few years.Thatâs in line with the central bankâs new strategy unveiled last August, in which Fed officials will seek above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation, so that it averages 2% over time.âI am of the camp where we stick with our framework and we let inflation run above 2% for a while -- not out of control past 2%,â Harker said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.Â©2021 Bloomberg L.P.

Asda bosses have lost an equal pay fight with tens of thousands of store workers in a Supreme Court ruling in a \"watershed moment\" for the industry. More than 44,000 current and former workers, about two-thirds of whom are women, brought equal pay claims saying staff working in distribution depots, most of whom are men, are paid more. The Supreme Court backed an earlier Court of Appeal judgment that ruled store workers are entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff for equal pay purposes. The decision, a landmark precedent for the private sector, will send shockwaves through the industry, paving the way for compensation claims against other supermarkets totalling as much as Â£8bn. Equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue, but the ruling demonstrates that private sector firms are not immune and could open the floodgates to more claims. \"It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those that have similar staffing models and pay structures,\" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood.

Earlier this week, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced that customers could now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but Ark Invest\\'s Cathie Wood isnât so sure investors should use it as a means of payment. What Happened: In a webcast hosted by CBOE, Wood said that those that made profits from Bitcoinâs rally may be the subject of scrutiny by the IRS. The ARK Invest founder explained, \"The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your bitcoin, I don\\'t think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front.â Why It Matters: From a tax point of view, the IRS currently treats Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as âproperty,â as they do stocks and bonds. As a result, when investors sell their Bitcoin for fiat currency or use it as a means to purchase another good, they could be subject to massive capital gains taxes. Capital gains on taxes on assets that have been held for less than a year are taxed the same as a personâs âother income,â while assets that are held for longer than this period would be subject to long-term capital gains taxes ranging from 15-20%. While this would make any Tesla purchases with Bitcoin somewhat unfavorable for those that bought the cryptocurrency last year, more recent investors may actually benefit from the current rules. For instance, if an investor purchased the leading cryptocurrency at a higher price than its current value, he or she could actually report a loss and receive a tax deduction for the value of the asset. Price Action: After a volatile week, Bitcoin price recovered from yesterday\\'s low of $50,856 to $53,900 today. At press time, the cryptocurrency was trading at $53,223, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Related Stories Should you Buy a Tesla with BTC?

An unstoppable force is taking over our financial markets. But most Americans wonât see whatâs going on until itâs too late. Hereâs whatâs coming. Nowhere is this clearer than in Nigeria, where the central bank is so worried about Nigerians choosing cryptocurrencies over the naira for overseas remittance payments that it is now paying them to use official channels for those transfers instead.  The central bank announced the scheme after international remittances inflows plummeted last year, as more Nigerians abandoned official banking channels by turning to cheaper cryptocurrency exchanges.  The move came on the heels of a nationwide crackdown on banks dealing in cryptocurrencies, which the government enacted in an attempt to counteract the nairaâs declining value. For more than a year now, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) has been ripping higher off of its pandemic lows. Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said Friday the stock market rally has been supported by four major pillars over the past year. Unfortunately, two of those pillars may now be cracking, putting the market at risk in the near-term. Essaye listed the following four bullish catalysts as pillars of the stock market rally over the past year. 1. Government stimulus. The U.S. government has already spent about $6 trillion in stimulus to prop up the economy throughout the pandemic downturn. The recent $1.9-trillion stimulus package will likely be the last one, and Essaye said this stock market pillar is now cracked. âBottom line, the outlook for government spending is turning much more mixed, because while there may be more spending (which is good for growth), itâs going to come with tax increases (which is bad for growth), and that mixed outlook is a departure from the past year (where it was all spending and no tax increases),â Essaye said. Related Link: Could Long-Term Capital Gains Selling Be Weighing On The Market? 2. Federal Reserve Accommodation. The Fed dropped its target fed funds interest rate range to between 0% and 0.25% and has been purchasing $120 billion in assets per month to help maintain a healthy credit market. Essaye said this pillar is now also cracked given a growing number of Fed officials said they see a rate hike coming in 2022 as of the Fedâs most recent dot plot projections. 3. Vaccine Optimism. Essaye said vaccine optimism has been a bullish catalyst throughout the rally, from positive critical trial data to FDA approvals to a U.S. vaccine rollout that\\'s now ahead of schedule. Unfortunately, Essaye said financial markets have already priced in an end to the pandemic within the next few months, so it\\'s unclear how much stock market upside the vaccine rollout can provide moving forward. 4. No Double-Dip Recession. It seems like a lifetime ago that investors were concerned about a potential double-dip recession in 2020 or 2021. However, employment and earnings have been steadily trending in the right direction, and the chances of a double-dip recession appear extremely low at this point. Benzingaâs Take: The economy is well-positioned to bounce back aggressively in 2021. It remains to be seen if there is more upside to stock prices once support from government stimulus and the Federal Reserve are scaled back.

Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK) is down over 30% since it reached an all-time-high of $159.70 on Feb. 16, but options traders may be seeing more downside for Cathie Woodâs fund, which holds shares of companies that Wood feels are disruptive innovators. The ARKK Trades: At 2:09 p.m. Thursday a trader executed a put sweep of 7,238 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring April 16. The trade represented a $38,000 bearish bet for which the trader paid $5.25 per option contract. At 1:04 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 400 ARKK options with a $110 strike price expiring on Jan. 20, 2023. The trade represented a $1.4-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $26 per option contract. At 11:16 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,500 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring May 21. The trade represented a $2.49-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.60 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 819 ARKK options with a $100 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.35-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,028 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May. 21. The trade represented a $1.7-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.50 per option contract. At 11:15 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep of 1,087 ARKK options with a $125 strike price expiring on May 21. The trade represented a $1.78-million bearish bet for which the trader paid $16.40 per option contract. Together, traders are betting almost $8.76 million that the share price of ARKK is going lower. Why Itâs Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating a large move in stock price will occur imminently. A sweeper pays market price for the call options, instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates âsmart moneyâ has entered into a position. About ARKK: Cathie Woodâs Ark ETFs have been wildly popular this year, and retail investors watch the fundâs activity daily to see which companies are being bought and sold. ARKK holds numerous stocks in this fund popular with retail traders such as Telsa Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG). Although ARKK holds some pharmaceuticals and biosciences companies, most of its holdings are in the tech sector, which is in a rout.

One of the best ways to build long-term wealth in the stock market is to buy into great companies and then hang on as long as the companies remain in good shape and have solid growth prospects. Here are three contenders for your portfolio that all have very promising futures -- and they\\'re all stocks I currently own, and plan to hang onto for a long time. See if any of them might be a good fit for you. Image source: Getty Images. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is a warehouse retailer familiar to most Americans, and to many people in more far-flung areas such as Europe and Japan. As of early January, it was the third-largest global retailer and the 14th-largest company in the Fortune 500, with a recent market value of $148 billion and around 275,000 employees. One of the keys to Costco\\'s success is its membership-based business model, which boasts 59 million member households and generates about $3.5 billion in annual revenue just from customers paying for the privilege of shopping at Costco and enjoying its benefits. Customers generally don\\'t end up regretting that membership, either -- renewal rates are 88% on a global basis. Costco, like most other companies, was challenged by the pandemic. But it reacted well, and ended up seeing its e-commerce operations grow by 50% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 as more members ordered goods delivered. It acquired a logistics company, too, to improve its deliver service. Indeed, Costco\\'s revenue rose 9.3% over fiscal 2020, while earnings grew 9.4%. Costco\\'s dividend recently yielded only 0.85%, but those who buy in at recent levels are likely to enjoy dividends that grow at a rapid clip -- dividend growth averaged 12% annually over the past five years. And on top of that, the company occasionally issues special dividends, such as the $10-per-share one from late last year and a $7-per-share one in 2017. This is a very solid long-term portfolio candidate\\xa0with a promising future. Unlike Costco, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, offers no dividend. But that\\'s OK, as the stock alone is likely to grow at a healthy clip over the coming years. Part of the reason why is because Alphabet encompasses more businesses than just its dominant search engine. (That\\'s why it changed\\xa0its name to Alphabet in 2015 -- with a fancy new web address, abc.xyz.) Alphabet also encompasses Google Cloud, for example, which grew its revenue by 46% between fiscal 2019 and 2020, and YouTube.com as well. YouTube has grown into a major Internet property, with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai noting that, \"more than half a million channels live streamed on YouTube for the first time in 2020.\" The company also owns the Google Play store, smart thermostat-maker Nest, and Fitbit, among other things. Alphabet is one of the most richly valued companies on Earth, with a recent market capitalization of nearly $1.4 trillion. That might make you think it can\\'t grow too fast -- but you\\'d be wrong. In its fourth quarter it blew past estimated earnings per share (EPS) of $15.90, reporting $22.30 on $56.9 billion in revenue, up 23% year-over-year. Income from operations popped\\xa069%. Its full-year fiscal 2020 revenue jumped 13% over 2019 levels, with income from operations rising 20%. There\\'s a lot to like about Alphabet. Image source: Getty Images. That brings us to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which I own not only for its great business but also for a sillier reason: I wince at the thought of paying $5 or more for a fancy beverage, but since I own shares and have made thousands of dollars from Starbucks over the years I can rationalize splurging now and then. But back to the business: Starbucks\\' market value recently topping $126 billion, and the company already boasts nearly 33,000 locations, and hopes to have 55,000 locations by 2030 -- in which case it would surpass both McDonald\\'s\\xa0and Subway in number of locations. Starbucks\\' first-quarter earnings report, released in January, revealed a company getting back on track after being whacked by the pandemic. Full-year revenue for fiscal 2020 fell 11% year-over-year to $23.5 billion, but fourth-quarter revenue only dropped 8%. The Starbucks mobile app helped the company make it through the worst of the pandemic, with CEO Kevin Johnson noting in the January conference call with analysts: This quarter, mobile orders represented 25% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q1, up from 17% before the pandemic, providing clear evidence that our initiatives are resonating with customers. We continue to see average tickets meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels driven by group order, a combination of increased beverage attach, premium beverage mix, increased customization and upsizing, and an all-time high food attachment all drove U.S. ticket growth of approximately 19% in Q1. Starbucks stock pays a dividend that recently yielded 1.7%, and it has been hiking that payout by an annual average of 18% over the past five years. If it grows at the same rate over the next five years, the $1.80 per share total annual payout would rise to $4.05. Any of these blue-chip stocks\\xa0could serve you well over the long haul. Take a closer look at any that interest you.  Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.
